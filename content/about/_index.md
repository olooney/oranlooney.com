Hi, I'm Oran Looney. I do math. I write programs. I science... data? That
doesn't sound right.  I -tican stats? No, that's even worse. My ideal job title
would be Senior Nematode Wrangler because many of the neural networks I work
with are roughly the same complexity as the [*C. elegans*][N]
[connectome][CEC]. Sadly, this is not yet a recognized specialty within the
broader field of machine learning.

I hold master's degrees in physics and math and have worked in the healthcare
sector doing software development and data science for two decades. These days
I'm professionally interested in machine learning, applied statistics, data
visualization, software architecture, and healthcare informatics.

I am currently working full time but am open to new opportunities. If you'd
like to hire me, please take a look at my [resume][RPDF] and get in touch if it
seems relevant. The best way to contact me is through email at <a
href="mailto:olooney@gmail.com">olooney@gmail.com</a> or to message me on 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oran-looney/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

Outside of work, I enjoy recreational mathematics, programming challenges such
as [Advent of Code][1] or [leetcode][2], and puzzle games like [Baba Is
You][BIY]. I maintain a repository of [quotes][Q] and [poems][P] containing
pithy wit and wisdom for programming and science. I sometimes make <a
href="/games/">small web games or demos.</a> As for my other amateur interests,
well, I can only refer you to all the [topics][T] covered on this site.

<!--
I sometimes make small web toys like a satirical ["AI" feedback generator][AFG], 
a really-quite-good-once-you-get-past-the-graphics [typing game][FW], or 
animated [design elements][DE] for a hypothetical "high tech" landing page. 
-->

I've also been thrilled by the recent wave of recreational mathematics and
other educational content on YouTube such as
[3Blue1Brown][6], 
[Ben Eater][7],
[Folding Ideas][FI], 
[Mathologer][10],
[Steve Mould][SM],
[Two Minute Papers][TMP],
[Veritasium][14], or
[Welch Labs][WL].
I think this new wave of math and science popularizers are
doing great work and I encourage you to check them out and support them if you
can.  Or if you're just feeling charitable in general, consider supporting
[Wikipedia][8] or [helping hungry children in Wisconsin][9].

This site was built with [blogdown][15], an R package that combines
[Pandoc][16] with the static site generator [Hugo][17]. It makes extensive use
of [MathJax][18] for formatting
<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
equations. Articles that are mainly in R are authored in [Rmarkdown][19] while
articles that are mainly in Python are first authored in a [Jupyter Lab][20]
and then ported to vanilla Markdown. Many of the photos come from
[Unsplash][21] due to its good selection of images with permissive licenses.
For HTTPS, it uses a free SSL cert from [Let's Encrypt][23].
