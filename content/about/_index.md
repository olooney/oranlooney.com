Hi, I'm Oran Looney. I do math. I write programs. I science... data? That
doesn't sound right.  I -tican stats? No, that's even worse.

My ideal job title would be Senior Nematode Wrangler because many of the neural
networks I work with are roughly the same complexity as the [*C. elegans*][N]
worm's [connectome][CEC]. Sadly, this is not yet a recognized specialty within
the broader field of machine learning, so you should probably think of me as a
Data Scientist or a Machine Learning Engineer.

I hold master's degrees in physics and math and have worked in the healthcare
and insurance sectors doing software development and data science for two
decades. These days I'm professionally interested in data science, machine
learning, applied statistics, software architecture, and occasionally data
visualization.

I am currently actively looking for a new position; if you're hiring, please
take a look at my [résumé][RPDF] and get in touch if it looks like a good fit.

### Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy recreational mathematics, the [history of science and
mathematics][TH], programming challenges such as [Advent of Code][1] or
[leetcode][2], and puzzle games like [Baba Is You][BIY]. I maintain a
repository of [quotes and poems][Q] containing pithy wit and wisdom for
programming and science. I sometimes make [small web games and demos][G]. As for
my other interests, well, I can only refer you to all the [topics][T] covered
on this site.

I've also been thrilled by the recent wave of recreational mathematics and
other educational content on YouTube such as
[3Blue1Brown][6], 
[Ben Eater][7],
[Folding Ideas][FI], 
[Mathologer][10],
[Steve Mould][SM],
[Two Minute Papers][TMP],
[Veritasium][14], or
[Welch Labs][WL].
I think this new wave of math and science popularizers are
doing great work and I encourage you to check them out and support them if you
can.  Or if you're just feeling charitable in general, consider supporting
[Wikipedia][8] or [helping hungry children in Wisconsin][9].

### Colophon

This site was built with [blogdown][15], an R package that combines
[Pandoc][16] with the static site generator [Hugo][17]. It makes extensive use
of [MathJax][18] for formatting
<span class="latex">L<sup>a</sup>T<sub>e</sub>X</span>
equations. Articles that are mainly in R are authored in [Rmarkdown][19] while
articles that are mainly in Python are first authored in a [Jupyter Lab][20]
and then ported to vanilla Markdown. Many of the photos come from
[Unsplash][21] due to its good selection of images with permissive licenses.
For HTTPS, it uses a free SSL cert from [Let's Encrypt][23].
