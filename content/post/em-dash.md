I bring you news of the single most important intellectual discovery of our
generation: the hard problem of human consciousness has now been solved once
and for all.

For a long time, the ability to select squares containing traffic lights was
our best working definition of what it meant to be truly, deeply, authentically
human, but this was never *quite* satisfactory.

Now, in 2025, research philosophers have expanded that definition to include
the crucial missing ingredient: an inability to use an em dash. Thanks to their
efforts, we now know that ignorance of basic typography is the very essence of
the human soul, for surely the ability to remember a keyboard shortcut as
complex as `Alt+0151` or `Shift+Option+Hyphen` indicates a rote, mechanized
mind incompatible with the fluid nature of true human consciousness. Even
knowing that one can do a long press on the hyphen key on your phone's keyboard
demonstrates a kind of inhuman spiritual emptiness, a great void of being.

Personally, I am glad this philosophical breakthrough occurred, because it
turns out that several of the graphic designers and copywriters I've worked
with for years have secretly been "clankers" this whole time! It's amazing that
you can have lunch with someone every day, even attend their wedding, and not
realize they're an AI chatbot. This is what really drove home the crucial
importance of the em dash test for me.

I encourage everyone to remain ever vigilant and actively police any online or
real-life interactions they have with others, and to immediately accuse anyone
who uses an em dash (or who even pauses in conversation in a way that
*suggests* an em dash) of being an AI. Such interventions are hugely beneficial
to human civilization as a whole as they protect us from both AI and English
majors.
