A typical account of the history of computers and computer science starts with
[Babbage][CB] and his [Analytical Engine][AE]. There's some logic to that: our
modern conception of a "computer" is more or less synonymous with a [universal
Turing machine][UTM], which is to say a machine which can take a program as
input and carry out an arbitrary computation - anything less we tend to dismiss
as a mere "calculator."



Nor were considerations of time complexity ignored - when every operation is
carried out by hand, and the entire program might take years or even a lifetime
to complete, they naturally.

Babbage's machine did not spring Athena-like from his forehead.

I can't multiply two 10 digit (32 bit) numbers together. Not in my head,
anyway. But give me a piece a paper and its as easy as pie, if a little
tedious. 

A pencil and paper may not seem like very advanced technology, but it increases
your working memory space by about a factor of a thousand. (A typical human has
about 7 +/- 2 digits of working memory, while a single 8.5x11 inch sheet of
paper can easily hold 7,000 digits.)

Slide rules, logarithms, and trig tables provide a 10x to 100x speed-up,
depending on the number of digits of precision required.
