      <description>Ask the average CS student to tell you about the history of computing and they&amp;rsquo;ll probably start with Babbage&amp;rsquo;s Analytical Engine. Fair enough: our modern conception of a &amp;ldquo;computer&amp;rdquo; is strongly linked to the universal Turing machine, which can take a program as input and carry out an arbitrary computation&amp;mdash;anything less, we tend to dismiss as a mere &amp;ldquo;calculator.&amp;rdquo; Since Babbage was the first to propose a machine with conditional branching (making it Turing complete) it does mark a watershed moment.</description>

      <description>You might think it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely for any interesting mathematics to arise from incense appreciation, but that&amp;rsquo;s only because you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with the peculiar character of Muromachi (室町) era Japanese nobles.
There has never been a group of people, in any time or place, who were so driven to display their sophistication and refinement. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do to merely put out a few sticks of incense; no, you would have to prove that your taste was more exquisite, your judgment more refined, your etiquette more oblique.</description>
