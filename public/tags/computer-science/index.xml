      <title>A Seriously Slow Fibonacci Function</title>

      <description>I recently wrote an article which was ostensibly about the Fibonacci series but was really about optimization techniques. I wanted to follow up on its (extremely moderate) success by going in the exact opposite direction: by writing a Fibonacci function which is as slow as possible.
This is not as easy as it sounds: any program can trivially be made slower, but this is boring. How can we make it slow in a fair and interesting way?</description>

      <title>A Fairly Fast Fibonacci Function</title>

      <description>A common example of recursion is the function to calculate the \(n\)-th Fibonacci number:
def naive_fib(n): if n &amp;lt; 2: return n else: return naive_fib(n-1) + naive_fib(n-2) This follows the mathematical definition very closely but itâ€™s performance is terrible: roughly \(\mathcal{O}(2^n)\). This is commonly patched up with dynamic programming. Specifically, either the memoization:
from functools import lru_cache @lru_cache(100) def memoized_fib(n): if n &amp;lt; 2: return n else: return memoized_fib(n-1) + memoized_fib(n-2) or tabulation:</description>
