<p>What is a computer, really? Where did it come from? When did we realize we
could trick rocks into doing our math homework for us?</p>

<p>In this <a href="/post/history-of-computing-2/">two-part</a> series, I&rsquo;ll cover the origin and early history of
computing and computer science, starting in prehistoric Africa and ending in
Victorian-era England. Not exhaustively (because that would require an entire
book) but selectively, highlighting the most interesting innovations and
focusing on the untold (or at least less well known) stories. If I do my job
right, you&rsquo;ll practically hear a little &ldquo;Level Up!&rdquo; chime as the human race
unlocks a new ability with each discovery.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the oldest evidence of computation I&rsquo;m aware of.</p>

<h2 id="the-ishango-bone">The Ishango Bone</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishango_bone">Ishango Bone</a> is a scraped and polished mammal bone, four inches (10
cm) long and probably around 20,000 years old. Divided into three separate
columns are sixteen groups of short, parallel, evenly spaced notches which
could only have been made with a sharp stone knife:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/ishango_bone.jpg" alt="Ishango Bone" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite hard to see the notches in the above picture, so here&rsquo;s an AI
recreation of what it would have looked like when new:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/ishango_bone_clean.png" alt="Ishango Bone" /></p>

<p>Archaeologists have found plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_stick">tally sticks</a> at dig sites around the
world, but what makes this one special are the numbers encoded in the grouped
tally marks. There are three series of numbers, carved into three separate
sides:</p>

<ul>
<li>3, 6, 4, 8, 10, 5, 5, 7</li>
<li>11, 13, 17, 19</li>
<li>11, 21, 19, 9</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to spot the patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the first series, we see many examples of doubling and halving.</li>
<li>In the second, we see every prime number between 10 and 20.</li>
<li>In the third, two pairs of numbers each differing by 10.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">pareidolia</a>? I don&rsquo;t think so. If we apply <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerasking/book-1/master/ML%20Machine%20Learning-A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A3356%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C-88%2C560%2C0.75%5D">Tenenbaum&rsquo;s
&ldquo;number game&rdquo; approach</a>, it becomes clear that it would be
extraordinarily unlikely for so many meaningful patterns to appear, even when
we consider the larger hypothesis space of other patterns we also would have
found &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo; (tripling, powers of two, Fibonacci sequences, etc.) In
particular, the doubling and halving of the first series suggests that some
kind of mathematical calculation is taking place, making the Ishango bone the
oldest piece of evidence we have of humans using an external object for
computation.</p>

<h2 id="cuneiform-tablets">Cuneiform Tablets</h2>

<p>Which brings us to the first computer: the clay tablet.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322" target="_blank">
    <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/cuneiform_clay_tablet.png">
</a></p>

<p>Operation is simple: you press into the soft, wet clay with a <a href="https://cuneiform.neocities.org/CWT/howtowritecuneiform">stylus</a> to
make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform">cuneiform symbols</a>. You can smooth it over and re-use it for scratch
calculations, or bake it for permanent storage.</p>

<p>The above image is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322">Plimpton 322</a>, a Mesopotamian clay tablet about
four thousand years old, showing a table of known <a href="/post/complex-r/">Pythagorean triples</a>.
This suggests that even at that early date, mathematics had progressed beyond
counting and arithmetic and was already being studied for its abstract beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I hear you ask, &ldquo;how is poking mud with a stick a computer?&rdquo; To see
why, try the following 10-digit multiplication problem:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{array}{r}
\hspace{8mm} 6847027875 \\
\times \hspace{3mm} 2463797377 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All done? Were you able to do it in your head? Or did you resort to pen and paper?</p>

<p>Look, here&rsquo;s the calculation shown in gory detail using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_algorithm">grade-school multiplication</a> algorithm:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{array}{r}
\hspace{8mm} 6847027875 \\
\times \hspace{3mm} 2463797377 \\
\hline
47929195125 \\
479291951250 \\
2054108362500 \\
47929195125000 \\
616232508750000 \\
4792919512500000 \\
20541083625000000 \\
410821672500000000 \\
2738811150000000000 \\
13694055750000000000 \\
\hline
16869689318670883875 \\
\end{array}
\]</p>

<p>To do it without recourse to external storage, you&rsquo;d have to be able to store
a minimum of 51 digits in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory">working memory</a>: ten each for the original
factors, eleven more for the row you&rsquo;re currently working on, and up to twenty
for the running sum of rows. And that&rsquo;s assuming that you compute the running
total after each row! A running total saves space but wastes time; it&rsquo;s much
easier to write out all the rows first and then sum up the rows with carry.
However, that approach requires at least 150 digits of working memory. Maybe
some trained mnemonist could do that, but I sure couldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The human brain has about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">7±2 digits of working memory</a>, while a single
tablet can easily hold hundreds. Thus, while the tablet can&rsquo;t add even two
digits together, and a human can&rsquo;t store hundreds of digits in their head, the
system composed of the human and the tablet together <em>can</em>. So while it may not
seem like very advanced technology at first glance, by increasing the scribe&rsquo;s
effective working memory it trivializes calculations that would otherwise be
impossible.</p>

<h2 id="papyrus">Papyrus</h2>

<p>Before we move on, a brief word about papyrus. Why did I choose to talk about
clay tablets instead of papyrus? After all, the <a href="https://old.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-the-rhind-and-moscow-mathematical-papyri">Rhind and Moscow papyri</a>
are from roughly the same time period and also exhibit early abstract
mathematics:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/rhind_papyrus.png" alt="Rhind Papyrus" /></p>

<p>The reason is simple: papyrus was expensive and could not easily be reused. It
would have been used for important records, but was far too valuable to use as
scratch paper. Thus it would have been easily erasable clay tablets or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracon">ostraka</a> that were actually used to carry out such calculations.</p>

<h2 id="the-abacus">The Abacus</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve certainly seen an abacus before:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/abacus.jpg" alt="Abacus" /></p>

<p>And you probably know that each column of beads encodes a single digit. But if
you haven&rsquo;t practiced using one, you probably don&rsquo;t have any idea how fluent
they can be.</p>

<p>Want to add two numbers? Your fingers already know the procedure: push these
beads up, carry one over there, slide a few back down. Multiplication and
division? Same story: the algorithms are encoded in muscle memory and can be
executed very quickly, almost without conscious thought.</p>

<p>In other words, the abacus isn&rsquo;t just a calculator; it’s a prototypical
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine">register machine</a>.</p>

<p>Feynman tells <a href="https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/feynman.html">this story</a> about winning against an abacus in a cube root
competition through a combination of pure luck and mathematical intuition.
Afterwards, he concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the abacus, you don&rsquo;t have to memorize a lot of arithmetic combinations;
all you have to do is to learn to push the little beads up and down. You
don&rsquo;t have to memorize 9+7=16; you just know that when you add 9, you push a
ten&rsquo;s bead up and pull a one&rsquo;s bead down. So we&rsquo;re slower at basic
arithmetic, but we know numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny anecdote, but I think his conclusion is backwards. Physicists
often start with simple models that can be understood intuitively and solved
exactly, and then add real-world complexity back in as a series of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory">approximations</a> to obtain numerically precise predictions. Naturally,
Feynman views his approach (a moment of intuitive insight refined by later
calculation) as superior. But had he been a computer scientist he would have
realized that the very fact that the abacus operator was carrying out the
calculation <em>without</em> thinking about the specific numbers involved shows that
his approach is entirely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithmic</a>. If there&rsquo;s one thing that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">Turing, Church, and Gödel</a> can all agree on, it&rsquo;s that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_method">rote, unthinking
procedures</a> are the essence of computation.</p>

<h2 id="ptolemy-s-almagest">Ptolemy&rsquo;s Almagest</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy</a> was an astronomer active in 2nd-century CE Alexandria.
His <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest"><em>Almagest</em></a> is the second most successful textbook of all time,
surpassed only by Euclid&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements"><em>Elements</em></a>. It includes everything that
was known at the time about the theory and practice of astronomy and continued
to be widely used until the Copernican revolution in the 16th century.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a tremendous amount that could be said about this influential book but
we&rsquo;ll focus on only a section that has direct relevance to our topic: the
table of chords. If you want a more in-depth analysis of <em>Almagest</em> as a whole,
the blog <a href="https://jonvoisey.net/blog/">Following Kepler</a> has done a multi-year <a href="https://jonvoisey.net/blog/2018/05/almagest-index/#more-368">deep dive</a> into it.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;chord&rdquo; is a line segment which connects two points on a circle. The table of
chords relates the opposite angle (in degrees) to the length of chord;
essentially the same relationship as $\sin(\theta)$ in modern trigonometry with
some scaling factors:</p>

<p>\[
\operatorname{chord}(\theta) = 2 R \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]</p>

<p>Ptolemy precalculated this chord length for a large number of angles and
published them as a table in his book. It wasn&rsquo;t quite the first such
table<a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/XKsPaX2NVOs?si=IyHbls2EdumElmsS">&mdash;</a>Hipparchus
had earlier developed a similar table of chords&mdash;but that table is now
lost and is thought to have been less extensive than Ptolemy&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Here is a small sample of Ptolemy&rsquo;s table, from a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00218286221140848">later Latin edition</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/almagest.png" alt="Almagest Chord Table" /></p>

<p>The column labeled &ldquo;Arcu&rdquo; is the angle; the &ldquo;partes&rdquo; is the angle in degrees
and the &ldquo;m&rdquo; (for minuta) is one-sixtieth of a degree, so we can see each
row represents a half-degree increment.</p>

<p>The column labelled &ldquo;Chordarum&rdquo; is the chord length given to a precision of
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3600</sub>, or about four decimal places. The table runs from $0^{\circ}$ to
$180^{\circ}$ in half-degree increments so has about 360 rows. It would have
been an impressive accomplishment in the 12th century, let alone the 2nd.</p>

<p>How did Ptolemy create this table? He used the theorem that bears his name to
this day. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy%27s_theorem">Ptolemy&rsquo;s theorem</a> gives a relationship between the edges and
diagonals of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_quadrilateral">cyclic quadrilateral</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/ptolemy_theorem.png" alt="Ptolemy Theorem" /></p>

<p>\[
    \overline{AD} \times \overline{BC} +
    \overline{AB} \times \overline{CD} =
    \overline{AC} \times \overline{BD}
\]</p>

<p>While seemingly elegant, it&rsquo;s probably not at all obvious at first glance how
this could have any practical use. It turns out, though, that it&rsquo;s a powerful
Swiss army knife for working with angles and chord lengths. To see how, let&rsquo;s
translate it into trigonometry so that it&rsquo;s more recognizable to modern
readers.</p>

<p>We do this by setting up the quadrilateral in a special way. We&rsquo;ll choose $B$
and $D$ to be exactly opposite on the circle, and the diameter $\overline{BD}$
to be exactly one. Then we consider two angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, on
opposite sides of this line:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/angle_addition.png" alt="Angle Addition Theorem" /></p>

<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle">inscribed angle theorem</a>, $\angle DAB$ and $\angle DCB$ are both
right angles. That gives us two right triangles with hypotenuse $1$, so we
can easily label the edge lengths as $\overline{BC} = \sin(\alpha)$,
$\overline{AD} = \cos(\beta)$ and so on.</p>

<p>Now we can apply Ptolemy&rsquo;s theorem. Since we chose $\overline{DB} = 1$,
the right-hand side is just $\overline{AC}$. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_sines">law of sines</a>,
$\overline{AC} = \sin(\alpha+\beta)$. Thus Ptolemy&rsquo;s theorem gives us the
<a href="/post/angle-addition/">angle addition formula</a>:</p>

<p>\[
    \sin(\alpha{+}\beta) = \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta)
\]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s this theorem that allowed Ptolemy to build out his table. He first
calculated $\sin(1^{\circ})$ and $\sin(½^{\circ})$ and repeatedly added them
together starting from the nearest known value (such as $\sin(30^{\circ}) = ½$)
until the entire table was filled in.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the point where you leap up from your chair and loudly
complain, &ldquo;how is this a computer? It&rsquo;s not even a machine! It&rsquo;s just a book!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a table <em>is</em> a computing device, just as much as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-85">TI-85</a>. It&rsquo;s an
external object that greatly reduces the time it takes to perform a
calculation. Even modern computers routinely trade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff">space for time</a> with
lookup tables and caches.</p>

<p>How did Ptolemy decide on four decimal places? Why not three or five? He must
have known, probably through long experience, that after the handful of
calculations involved in finding the position of a planet you&rsquo;d still be left
with three sig figs&mdash;enough to actually find the object in the sky. Such
considerations anticipate modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis">numerical analysis</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sector">The Sector</h2>

<p>This device is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sector_(instrument)">sector</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.si.edu/object/italian-style-sector-jacobus-lusuerg:nmah_1127307" target="_blank">
    <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/sector.png">
</a></p>

<p>It seems kind of silly&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a hinge&mdash;but it&rsquo;s much more useful
than it first appears. The sector translates angles, for which there are few
useful tools, into distances, which can easily be manipulated with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_(drawing_tool)">compass</a>.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian has an extensive <a href="https://www.si.edu/spotlight/sectors">collection of historical sectors</a>, from
which the above image is borrowed.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo</a> produced and sold a sector described in his 1606 book
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/rbc0001.2010rosen1335/?st=gallery&amp;c=80"><em>The Operations of the Geometric and Military Compass</em></a>. His version
included multiple scales in an attempt to squeeze as many useful functions into
a single device as possible. It was, in a word, the scientific calculator of
his day.</p>

<p>Chris Staecker has a good video demonstrating in detail the use of this
specific sector for those who want to go into the details:</p>

<style>

</div>

<p>I want to draw attention to one scale in particular on Galileo&rsquo;s sector, the C
scale. The C scale is just a physical representation of Ptolemy&rsquo;s table of
chords. Open the sector to any angle and measure the distance across the sector
with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_compass">compass</a>; that&rsquo;s the chord length. Pick up the compass and move it
to the C scale on the sector; the value you read off is the angle in degrees.
This process can be reversed as well, allowing you to open the sector to a
particular angle that you only know as a number of degrees.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of using a sector for this purpose when compared to Ptolemy&rsquo;s
table is that you only get two or three sig figs, which is often sufficient
for practical navigation work but not necessarily for precise astronomy. The
advantage, of course, is that the operation is far more convenient than
consulting a table.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll see this tension between precision and computation time again when we
discuss the logarithm, but first I want to spend a little time on one of the
underappreciated giants of early computation.</p>

<h2 id="edmund-gunter">Edmund Gunter</h2>

<p>Edmund Gunter was a prolific inventor and proponent of practical computing
devices, tables, and techniques. Many of his inventions and incremental
improvements can be found in the posthumously published <a href="https://archive.org/details/worksofedmundgun00gunt_0/page/n5/mode/2up"><em>Works of
Edmund Gunter</em></a>. A few of the more famous are Gunter&rsquo;s quadrant, a kind
of astrolabe:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/gunter_quadrant.png" alt="Gunter's Quadrant" /></p>

<p>A table of trig functions given to an unprecedented seven decimal places of precision:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/gunter_table.png" alt="Gunter's Canon Triangulorum" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunter%27s_chain">Gunter&rsquo;s chain</a>, used by surveyors to measure distances over rough
terrain which continued in common use until surprisingly recently:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/gunter_chain.jpg" alt="Gunter's Chain" /></p>

<p>And numerous others. Really, just go flip through his <a href="https://archive.org/details/worksofedmundgun00gunt_0/page/n5/mode/2up">book</a>; it&rsquo;s freely
available in full on the Internet Archive.</p>

<p>But the main reason I bring him up is so I can relate <a href="https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gunter/">this anecdote</a> which
I think tells us a lot about how computation was viewed until quite recently,
before Turing et al. put it on a respectable academic footing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Gunter] brought with him his sector and quadrant, and fell to resolving
triangles and doing a great many fine things. Said the grave knight [Savile],
&ldquo;Do you call this reading of geometry? This is showing of tricks, man!&rdquo;, and
so dismissed him with scorn, and sent for Henry Briggs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote stood out for me because it highlights the extent to which his
contemporaries fixated on theory and devalued computation, a theme we&rsquo;ll return
to later.</p>

<h2 id="the-logarithm">The Logarithm</h2>

<p>The next leg of our journey is the logarithm, and in particular the two competing
(or perhaps complementary) ways of materializing it: the log table and the
slide rule.</p>

<p>The logarithm has its origin in an almost offhand comment by Michael Stifel on
the connection between exponents and arithmetic/geometric series in his book
<a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ywkW9hDd7IIC/page/n539/mode/2up"><em>Arithmetica Integra</em></a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_ywkW9hDd7IIC/page/n539/mode/2up">
  <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/arithmetic_geometric_series.png" alt="Arithmetica Integra, Volume III, pg. 249">
</a></p>

<p>The second comment under the table translates to, &ldquo;Just as geometric
progression operates by multiplication and division, arithmetic progression
follows addition and subtraction.&rdquo; The table itself shows several examples of
negative and positive exponents of 2, clearly illustrating the point.</p>

<p>In modern notation, we would write:
\[
\log(xy) = \log(x) + \log(y)
\]</p>

<p>The power of this statement&mdash;the magic really&mdash;is that addition and
multiplication are far more closely related than anyone had guessed. The
practical relevance to computation is that <em>addition</em> and <em>subtraction</em> are considerably faster and
easier than <em>multiplication</em> or <em>long division</em>&hellip; so if they&rsquo;re basically the
same thing, why not do it the easy way?</p>

<h2 id="john-napier">John Napier</h2>

<p>Napier had already been searching for a way to make multiplication faster, and
had had some success with a device called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier%27s_bones">Napier&rsquo;s bones</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/napiers_bones.jpg" alt="Napier Bones" /></p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know if Napier took inspiration from Stifel or not; <em>Arithmetica
Integra</em> was a very famous book (it introduced exponents and negative numbers)
so perhaps Napier had read it, or perhaps he developed the idea completely
independently. But at some point he grasped the importance of the logarithm and
how it could be used to efficiently perform multiplication.</p>

<p>He then spent an unknown number of hours in painstaking calculation over the
next twenty years working out his tables to seven decimal places in a book he
called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirifici_Logarithmorum_Canonis_Descriptio"><em>Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio</em></a>, or the
<em>Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms</em>, published in 1614.</p>

<p>After a brief description of how to use the table, the remaining <a href="https://archive.org/details/mirificilogarit00napi/page/n161/mode/2up">90 pages</a> of
the book all look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/napier_table.jpg" alt="Wonderful Canon of Logarithms" /></p>

<p>They give the logarithms (and closely related sines) to seven decimal places.</p>

<p>Napier&rsquo;s book was a success and was immediately put to good use by scientists
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, who referred to it as a &ldquo;<a href="https://www.milestone-books.de/pages/books/001922/johannes-kepler/tabulae-rudolphinae-quibus-astronomicae-scientiae-temporum-longinquitate-collapsae?soldItem=true">happy calamity</a>&rdquo; because its
timely publication saved him an enormous amount of effort in the construction
of his own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolphine_Tables">planetary tables</a>.</p>

<p>Napier&rsquo;s table of logarithms was a monumental breakthrough. It was a personal
triumph: the glorious marriage of genius and industry. It attracted immediate
and widespread acclaim. And it was obsolete almost from the moment the ink was
dry.</p>

<h2 id="henry-briggs">Henry Briggs</h2>

<p>Napier had made one unfortunate decision in his table; he implicitly chose
a base of $\frac{1}{e}$ and a scale factor of $10^7$:</p>

<p>\[
n(x) = -10^7 \ln\left(\frac{x}{10^7}\right)
\]</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; because this convention adds an ugly magic number to every
multiplication operation:</p>

<p>\[
n(xy) = n(x) + n(y) - 161180956
\]</p>

<p>This constant arises because $10^7 \ln\left(10^{7}\right) \;\approx\;
161180956.509\ldots$ Not a huge deal, but it does add an extra step to every
single calculation.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Briggs_(mathematician)">Henry Briggs</a> (the same one mentioned in the Edmund Gunter anecdote
above) who realized that this constant could be eliminated entirely. He
proposed what we would today call the base 10 logarithm:</p>

<p>\[
    \log_{10}(xy) = \log_{10}(x) + \log_{10}(y)
\]</p>

<p>Briggs discussed his idea with Napier, and then spent several years working out
the new and improved table by hand, ultimately publishing it as the <a href="https://archive.org/details/arithmeticalogar00brig/page/n5/mode/2up"><em>Arithmetica
Logarithmica</em></a> in 1624. It included 30,000 rows and gave its results to
fourteen decimal places.</p>

<p>The logarithm revolutionized computation. Anyone who needed to multiply,
divide, or find roots of numbers to a high degree of precision could now do so
quickly and reliably. There was only one problem with the method: very often,
one needed only a handful of significant figures, for which purposes flipping
through the lengthy tables was overkill. What was needed was some convenient
way to do quick-and-dirty calculations.</p>

[Jost Bürgi][JB2] - circular log table 



![Jost Bürgi Circular Logarithm](/post/history-of-computing_files/jost_burgi_circle.jpg)

A circle makes sense because every time you go up one order of magnitude, the
logarithm essentially repeats, just shifted over one decimal place.

Mechanical [circular slide rules][CSR] manufactured much later.

<h2 id="the-slide-rule">The Slide Rule</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really do justice to the full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule#History">history of the slide rule</a>, which saw
many improvements and incremental innovations during the three centuries in
which it was in widespread use, but will at least sketch its origin story.</p>

<p>Edmund Gunter was the <a href="https://nzeldes.com/article/gunter/">first</a> to print Napier&rsquo;s log scale on a ruler:</p>

<p><a href="https://nzeldes.com/article/gunter/" target="_blank">
    <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/gunter_rule.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>In conjunction with a compass, it could be used in a conceptually similar way
to a log table. To multiply two numbers $x$ and $y$, first find where the
number $x$ is printed on the log scale and use a compass to measure the
distance to the origin. This distance is roughly $\log(x)$. Then find the point
where $y$ is printed. Pick up the compass, pinching its pivot so that it
retains its length, and add that distance to the point for $y$. Since these two
lengths added together make $\log(x) + \log(y) = \log(xy)$, the number printed on
the scale at this new point is $x \times y$.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t terribly precise; maybe two or three sig figs in practice. But it&rsquo;s
a lot faster than flipping through 90 pages of tables.</p>

<p>It was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred">William Oughtred</a> who took the next step and gave us the first
recognizable slide rule by simply placing two Gunter rules next to each
other. This eliminated the need for a compass and made the whole operation
quicker and more precise. Oughtred&rsquo;s original slide rule does not survive, so
here is a much later version:</p>

<p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-large-ruler-mounted-to-the-side-of-a-wall-2IoVLcS3DnU?utm_content=creditShareLink&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash" target="_blank">
    <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/slide_rule_closeup.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>This later version features many innovations and ergonomic conveniences, such
as the cursor (a simple addition which greatly improves precision) and the
addition of other scales (for trigonometric functions, etc.) reminiscent of
the multiple scales engraved onto Galileo&rsquo;s sector.</p>

<p>Perhaps Oughtred would not have appreciated being remembered as &ldquo;the inventor
of the slide rule&rdquo; as he believed that mathematical proof was far more
important than mere calculation, which he likened to a juggler&rsquo;s tricks:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_the-circles-of-proportio_oughtred-william_1632/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank">
    <img src="/post/history-of-computing_files/william_oughtred_dedication.png">
</a></p>

<p>An attitude which echoes Savile&rsquo;s dismissal of Gunter. It&rsquo;s easy with the
benefit of hindsight to view this as naïve; after all, we know how important the
slide rule turned out to be, an importance that is only magnified when we view
it as a stepping stone to the modern computer. But none of this would have been
obvious even to the best minds of the time. Living in an essentially agrarian
society, writing with quill pens on parchment by candlelight, caught between
the church and feudal lords in a world of handcrafted objects, they could not
have conceived the value that a pocket slide rule would have to a 20th century
engineer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the greatest discoveries consist mainly in the clearing away of
psychological roadblocks which obstruct the approach to reality; which is
why, <em>post factum</em>, they appear so obvious.&rdquo;<br>&mdash;Arthur Koestler</p>
</blockquote>
