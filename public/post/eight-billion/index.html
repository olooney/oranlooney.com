<p>Today is the last day when the number of people alive will start with a seven.
Sometime late Tuesday afternoon, or perhaps early Wednesday morning, the
population will cross the eight billion mark. When I
was a kid, the number they taught us in school was five billion. By the time I
was in college, it was up to six, and a decade ago it hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Billion_Humans">seven</a>.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s eight. Is this just a factoid, a little piece of trivia we have to keep
updating so we can win pub quizzes?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. Oh, the specific number is arbitrary enough.  But the trend,
the larger pattern &mdash; that&rsquo;s important. Take a look at this graph:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#pastfuture" target="_blank" title+"World Population Clock Chart">
  <img src="/post/eight-billion_files/population.png">
</a></p>

<p>For most of human history, humans could by counted in the millions, not billions.
We hit one billion around 1800 have been growing exponentially ever since. I haven&rsquo;t
been around quite long enough to see it double, but my parents have. But here&rsquo;s one
interesting thing: it&rsquo;s not likely to double again, not unless something drastically
changes. The growth rate is slowing, the population curve is flattening out, and
current projections have the population stable at around 11 Billion by the year 2050.
Which means this past century may be completely unique - the only time in all of
history when six billion new humans were added in a single century.</p>

<h2 id="ecology-analogy">Ecology Analogy</h2>

<p>In ecology, they sometimes draw this sigmoid growth curve and divide it into phases:</p>

<p><img src="/post/eight-billion_files/sigmoid.png" alt="Ecology Sigmoid Curve" /></p>

<p>In a typical ecological model the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity">carrying capacity</a> is determined by
food supply,  but in the case of humans it seems to be driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition">demographic
transition</a> but some ideas still carry over. There was a period of exponential
growth where there always more young people around than old people. Resources seemed
unlimited and growth was unchecked. The <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/population-pyramid">population pyramid</a> is very wide at the bottom.</p>

<p>However, as we approach the plataeu, everything changes. Growth slows and
eventually stablizes. Competition over scarce resources increases. The
population pyramid narrows and there relatively fewer young people around.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan">Japan provides a sneak peak</a> into what we&rsquo;re likely to expect globally. In
Japan, their growth rate has already become negative, resulting in a large
elderly population that is straining their social support systems and weakening
the economy.</p>

<h2 id="regime-shift">Regime Shift</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little piece of folk wisdom from my days as physics student: &ldquo;If any
quantity changes by more than an order of magnitude, double check all your
approximations. They may no longer be valid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For example, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of <a href="https://physics.info/turbulence/">turbulent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow">laminar flow</a>.</p>

<div style="width: 320px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;">
<video controls autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/post/eight-billion_files/laminar_turbulent.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <img src="/post/eight-billion_files/laminar_turbulent.png" title="Static Illustration of Turbulent vs. Laminar Flow.">
</video>
</div>

<p>Both are fluid flows ultimately based on the same equations. There&rsquo;s
no hard cut-off between the two. But they behave extremely differently; so much
so that that its easier to try to understand them as two separate phenomena.</p>

<p>Changes in scale often result in this kind of so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_shift">regime shift</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Building a four-foot tower requires a steady hand, a level surface, and 10
undamaged beer cans. Building a 400 foot tower doesn&rsquo;t merely require 100
times as many beer cans.&rdquo; - Steve McConnell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can tell a similar story across a wide variety of problems. A human can run
about 8 miles per hour. To go from 8 mph to 80, you don&rsquo;t just &ldquo;run harder.&rdquo;
You need to build an engine or jump off a cliff. To go from 80 to 800, you need
a jet and an airframe specifically designed to break the sound barrier. At
8,000 mph the physics of airflow go through <em>another</em> qualitative shift as we
enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed">hypersonic regime.</a> Not only do you now need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet">scramjet</a>,
you also need to start seriously worrying about how your going to get rid of
all that heat. Each order of magnitude isn&rsquo;t just <em>harder</em>, it&rsquo;s completely and
qualitatively <em>different.</em></p>

<h2 id="rate-of-innovation">Rate of Innovation</h2>

<p>Population is not the only thing that&rsquo;s been growing exponentially. In his 1975
book <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1749640"><em>Science Since Babylon</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek de Solla</a> observed that the
number of PhDs being issued was doubling roughly every 20 years. This fact is
often communicated with the vivid expression, &ldquo;90% of all scientists who have
ever lived are alive today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While some of this is driven by population growth, increased availablity
of education also plays a role. As a result, this number is actually growing
<em>faster</em> than population.</p>

<p>All those scientists and engineers building and figuring out stuff
cause a lot of churn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the whispering quiet of Heaven&rsquo;s night you imagine you can hear the
paradigms shatter, shards of theory tinkling into brilliant dust as the
lifework of some corporate think tank is reduced to the tersest historical
footnote&hellip;
<br>- William Gibson, <em>Hinterlands</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first time I really felt this first-hand was working with JavaScript
frameworks circa 2010. It was a wild time. Entire frameworks would come into
existence, become <em>de facto</em> standards or best practices overnight, and be
considered outdated and untouchable a year or two later.</p>

<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re still generating HTML on the server? Haven&rsquo;t you heard about
AJAX and XHR? The X stands for XML which is going to be the Next Big Thing. Of course,
you would never <em>actually</em> pass XML; that&rsquo;s so last year.  (Yeah, that includes XHTML;
we&rsquo;re moving forward with HTML5 because it turns out getting developers to
consistently close their tags is <em>really</em> hard.) No, everyone is passing JSON to
REST APIs now. Actually, use jQuery to do it for you. What, you&rsquo;re still using
jQuery?  You gotta get up to speed with MVC frames like AngularJS. They&rsquo;ll bind
your data to HTML for you. Thank you for being an earlier adopter of AngularJS
1.0; please transition your project to AngularJS 2.0 where we&rsquo;ve broken
backwards compatibility every way we can think of, plus a couple new ways we
invented just for this project! Actually, let&rsquo;s all just use React. (How about
Vue? Oh, I&rsquo;m fine; how are you?)  Of course, you&rsquo;d never actually write your
own HTML/CSS; you&rsquo;d use components and a CSS framework like Bootstrap. But
obviously component libraries are rigid and inflexible and we should write our
own &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; HTML.  Don&rsquo;t forget to add responsive design! And support
Retina! And touch events. Gotta bend over backwards to support IE6 - just
kidding, it&rsquo;s all Chrome now. Don&rsquo;t use Python on the server &mdash; use
Node.js. Oh god NPM is so bad but never mind: gotta move fast, break things.
Don&rsquo;t use JavaScript &mdash; use CoffeeScript or TypeScript. Actually,
JavasScript is fine now. (Thanks ECMA!) Here&rsquo;s one way to package JavaScript into
modules. Here&rsquo;s another, incompatible way. Maybe a third-party library can help
unify the two? Oh, actually now there are three incompatible ways to package
modules.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that kind of maelstrom is going to become increasingly
common as the overall rate of innovation continues to increase. Workers in
a variety of fields will have to find their own strategies for coping with
this kind of constant, overwhelming flood of change. Programmers were able
to adapt by moving to CI/CD workflows, but programmers have always been
very good at writing their own tools to meet their own needs. Other fields
and industries won&rsquo;t necessarily have that capability and it&rsquo;s hard to
see how that will play out.</p>

<h2 id="before-and-after">Before and After</h2>

<p>If it&rsquo;s true that the population does stabilize at around 11 billion, then I
think future historians will draw a sigmoid population curve and divide history
into three phases - the low population era ancient and medieval history, the
transitional centuries, and steady state of what they will think of as
&ldquo;modernity.&rdquo; We, of course, would be in the pre-modern transitional period,
albeit at the tail end of that.</p>

<p>What will that new world look like? Well, there are something we can say:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Transitional Era</th>
<th>Future Steady State</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Population Growth</td>
<td>Exponential</td>
<td>Flat</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Population Pyramid</td>
<td>Wide Base of Young People</td>
<td>Narrow Pillar</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Population Distribution</td>
<td>Sparse</td>
<td>Dense</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Innovation Time Scale</td>
<td>Decades</td>
<td>Years</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Natural Resources</td>
<td>Plentiful</td>
<td>Constrained</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>These are the first-order, easily predictable effects. But they already
paint a picture of a very different world which will lead to second-order
effects which are much harder to predict.</p>

<p>To take one trivial example, currently workers in many fields are expected to
move up to management after they have a decade or two of experience. But
that model only works if there&rsquo;s a cheap and plentiful supply of young,
inexperienced people. If the population pyramid drastically changes shape,
that basic assumption could change and executing projects where all
the real work is done by the least experienced people may no longer be
the dominant strategy. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_lag">cultural lag</a> could mean it could
take a long time for people to realize that even if it does come true,
because concepts like hierarchy and expected career progression are
baked into our culture at an almost subconscious level.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s never going to be a specific date we can point to and say, &ldquo;there!
that was the day the modern world began!&rdquo; But eight billion people on November
15<sup>th</sup>, 2022 is as good as any a point as any other to start thinking
seriously about the end of exponential population growth, the increasingly
constrained resources of our planet, and the dizzying rate of change that will
characterize the rest of our lives.</p>
