<p>Today is the last day when the number of people alive will start with a seven.
Sometime late Tuesday afternoon, or perhaps early Wednesday morning, the
population will cross the eight billion mark. When I
was a kid, the number they taught us in school was five billion. By the time I
was in college, it was up to six, and a decade ago it hit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Billion_Humans">seven</a>.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s at eight. Is this just a factoid, a little piece of trivia only good
for winning pub quizzes?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. Oh, the specific number is arbitrary enough.  But the trend,
the larger pattern &mdash; that&rsquo;s <em>important</em>. Take a look at this graph:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#pastfuture" target="_blank" title+"World Population Clock Chart">
  <img src="/post/eight-billion_files/population.png">
</a></p>

<p>For most of human history, humans were counted in the millions, not billions.
We hit one billion around 1800 and have been growing exponentially ever since. I
haven&rsquo;t been around quite long enough to see it double in my lifetime, but my
parents have. Here&rsquo;s the interesting thing: it&rsquo;s not likely to double again,
not unless something drastically changes. The growth rate is slowing, the
population curve is flattening out, and current projections have the population
stable at around 11 Billion by the year 2050. Which means the past century may
be completely unique - the only time in all of history when six billion new
humans were added in a single century.</p>

<h2 id="ecology-analogy">Ecology Analogy</h2>

<p>In ecology, they sometimes draw this sigmoid growth curve and divide it into phases:</p>

<p><img src="/post/eight-billion_files/sigmoid.png" alt="Ecology Sigmoid Curve" /></p>

<p>In a typical ecological model the maximum population, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrying_capacity">carrying
capacity</a>, is determined by food supply or predation, while in the case of
humans it seems to be driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition">demographic transition</a>. But the
effect is the same: there is a period of growth where there are always more
young people around than middle aged people, and more middle aged people than
elderly. Resources seemed unlimited and growth was unchecked. The <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/population-pyramid">population
pyramid</a> is very wide at the bottom:</p>

<p><img src="/post/eight-billion_files/wide_population_pyramid.png" alt="Wide Population Pyramid" /></p>

<p>However, as we begin to approach the carrying capacity, everything changes. We
hit a plateau: growth slows and eventually disappears entirely. Competition
over scarce resources increases. The population pyramid narrows and there
relatively fewer young people around:</p>

<p><img src="/post/eight-billion_files/narrow_population_pyramid.png" alt="Narrow Population Pyramid" /></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan">Japan provides a sneak peek</a> into what we&rsquo;re likely to expect domestically
over the next few decades, and globally over the next century. In
Japan, the growth rate has already become negative, resulting in a large
elderly population that is straining their social support systems, a weak
economy, and little opportunity for advancement.</p>

<h2 id="regime-shift">Regime Shift</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little piece of folk wisdom from my days as a physics student: &ldquo;If any
quantity changes by more than an order of magnitude, double check all your
approximations. They may no longer be valid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For example, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of <a href="https://physics.info/turbulence/">turbulent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow">laminar flows</a>:</p>

<div style="width: 320px; padding: 0px; margin: auto;">
<video controls autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="/post/eight-billion_files/laminar_turbulent.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <img src="/post/eight-billion_files/laminar_turbulent.png" title="Static Illustration of Turbulent vs. Laminar Flow.">
</video>
</div>

<p>Both are fluid flows ultimately based on the same equations. There&rsquo;s no hard
cut-off between the two. The only difference is which approximations we use.
But they behave completely differently; so much so that it&rsquo;s easier to try
to understand them as two separate phenomena.</p>

<p>Changes in scale often result in this kind of so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_shift">regime shift</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Building a four-foot tower requires a steady hand, a level surface, and 10
undamaged beer cans. Building a 400 foot tower doesn&rsquo;t merely require 100
times as many beer cans.&rdquo; - Steve McConnell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can tell a similar story across a wide variety of problem domains. A human
can run about 8 miles per hour. To go from 8 mph to 80 mph, you don&rsquo;t just need
to &ldquo;run harder.&rdquo; You need to build an engine or jump off a cliff. To go from 80
to 800, you need a jet and an airframe specifically designed to break the sound
barrier. At 8,000 mph the physics of airflow go through <em>another</em> qualitative
shift as we enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersonic_speed">hypersonic regime.</a> Now you need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet">scramjet</a>
and a way to dump all the excess heat. Each order of magnitude isn&rsquo;t just
<em>harder</em>, it&rsquo;s completely and qualitatively <em>different.</em></p>

<h2 id="rate-of-innovation">Rate of Innovation</h2>

<p>Population is not the only thing that&rsquo;s been growing exponentially. In his 1975
book <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/1749640"><em>Science Since Babylon</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_J._de_Solla_Price">Derek de Solla</a> observed that the
number of PhDs being issued was doubling roughly every 20 years. This fact is
often communicated with the vivid expression, &ldquo;90% of all scientists who have
ever lived are alive today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While some of this is driven by population growth, increased availability
of education also plays a role. As a result, this number is actually growing
<em>faster</em> than population. And that might continue even after population
growth has levelled off.</p>

<p>All those scientists and engineers building and figuring stuff out cause a lot
of change. And the rate of change increases proportional to the number of
scientists, which is only going up. Even as population growth levels off,
technological innovation is only going to speed up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the whispering quiet of Heaven&rsquo;s night you imagine you can hear the
paradigms shatter, shards of theory tinkling into brilliant dust as the
lifework of some corporate think tank is reduced to the tersest historical
footnote&hellip;&rdquo;
<br>- William Gibson, <em>Hinterlands</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first time I really felt this firsthand was working with JavaScript
frameworks circa 2010. It was a wild time. Entire frameworks would come into
existence, become <em>de facto</em> standards overnight, and be considered outdated
and untouchable a year or two later.</p>

<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re still generating HTML on the server? Haven&rsquo;t you heard about AJAX
and XHR? The X stands for XML which is going to be the Next Big Thing. Of
course, we would never <em>actually</em> pass XML; that&rsquo;s so last year.  (Yeah, that
includes XHTML; we&rsquo;re moving forward with HTML5 instead because it turns out getting
developers to consistently close their tags is <em>really</em> hard.) No, everyone is
passing JSON to REST APIs now. Actually, use jQuery to do it for you. What,
you&rsquo;re still using jQuery? You gotta get up to speed with MVC frames like
AngularJS. They&rsquo;ll bind your data to HTML for you. Thank you for being an
earlier adopter of AngularJS 1.0; please transition your project to AngularJS
2.0 where we&rsquo;ve broken backwards compatibility every way we can think of, plus
a couple new ways we invented just for this project! Actually, let&rsquo;s all just
use React. (How about Vue? Oh, I&rsquo;m fine; how are you?)  Of course, you&rsquo;d never
actually write your own HTML/CSS; you&rsquo;d use components and a CSS framework like
Bootstrap. But obviously component libraries are rigid and inflexible and we
should be writing our own &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; HTML. Don&rsquo;t forget to add responsive
design! And support Retina displays! And touch events. Firefox is great but
don&rsquo;t forget to bend over backwards to support IE6 - just kidding, it&rsquo;s all
Chrome now. Don&rsquo;t use Python on the server &mdash; use Node.js. Oh God NPM is
so bad but never mind: gotta move fast, break things. Don&rsquo;t use JavaScript
&mdash; use CoffeeScript or TypeScript. Actually, JavasScript is fine now.
(Thanks ECMA!) Here&rsquo;s one way to package JavaScript into modules. Here&rsquo;s
another, incompatible way. Maybe a third-party library can help unify the two?
Oh, now there are three incompatible ways to package modules.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that kind of maelstrom will become increasingly common as the
overall rate of innovation continues to increase. Workers in a variety of
fields will have to find their own strategies for coping with a constant,
overwhelming flood of change. Programmers were able to adapt by moving to agile
methodologies and CI/CD pipelines but then again, programmers have always been
uniquely good at writing their own tools. Other fields and industries won&rsquo;t
necessarily have that capability.</p>

<h2 id="before-and-after">Before and After</h2>

<p>If the projections are true and the population does stabilize at around 11
billion, then I think future historians will draw a sigmoid population curve
and divide history into three phases - the low population era of ancient and
medieval history, the transitional growth era we&rsquo;re in now, and the steady
state era of what they will think of as &ldquo;modernity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What will that new world look like? Well, there are some things we can say:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Transitional Era</th>
<th>Future Steady State</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Population Growth</td>
<td>Exponential</td>
<td>Flat</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Population Pyramid</td>
<td>Wide Base of Young People</td>
<td>Narrow Pillar</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Population Distribution</td>
<td>Sparse</td>
<td>Dense</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Innovation Time Scale</td>
<td>Decades</td>
<td>Years</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Natural Resources</td>
<td>Plentiful</td>
<td>Constrained</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>These are the first-order, easily predictable effects. But they already
paint a picture of a very different world which will lead to second-order
effects which are much harder to predict.</p>

<p>To take one trivial example, currently workers in many fields are expected to
move up to management after they have a decade or two of experience. But that
model only works if there&rsquo;s a cheap and plentiful supply of young,
inexperienced people to swell the ranks. If the population pyramid drastically
narrows, that basic assumption will fail and executing projects where all the
real work is done by the least experienced people may no longer be the dominant
strategy. Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_lag">cultural lag</a> means it could take a long time for
people to realize that the way they&rsquo;ve always it their whole life no longer
works. Concepts like &ldquo;expected career progression&rdquo; are baked into our culture
at an almost subconscious level.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s never going to be a specific date we can point to and say, &ldquo;there! that
was the day the modern world began!&rdquo; But eight billion people on November
15<sup>th</sup>, 2022 is as good a date as any to nominate for that honor. It&rsquo;s
time we start thinking seriously about the end of exponential population
growth, the increasingly constrained resources of our planet, and the dizzying
rate of change that will characterize the rest of our lives.</p>
