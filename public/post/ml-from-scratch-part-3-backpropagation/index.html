      <p>In today’s installment of <a href="/tags/from-scratch/">Machine Learning From Scratch</a> we’ll build on
the <a href="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-2-logistic-regression/">logistic regression from last time</a> to create a classifier which is
able to automatically represent non-linear relationships and interactions
between features: the neural network. In particular I want to focus on one
central algorithm which allows us to apply gradient descent to deep neural
networks: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">backpropagation algorithm</a>. The history of this algorithm
appears to be <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html">somewhat complex</a> (as you can hear from <a href="https://youtu.be/Svb1c6AkRzE">Yann LeCun himself
in this 2018 interview</a>) but luckily for us the algorithm in its modern
form is not difficult - although it does require a solid handle on linear
algebra and calculus.</p>
<p>I am indebted to the many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyyJKd-zXRE&amp;list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599&amp;index=6">dedicated educators</a> who taken the time to
prepare <a href="https://gormanalysis.com/introduction-to-neural-networks/">in-depth</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8">easy-to-understand</a>, and <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html">mathematically
rigorous</a> presentations of the subject and will not attempt to yet
another; my intention with this article is simply to derive the backpropagation
algorithm, implement a working version from scratch, and to discuss the
practical implications of introducing are more powerful representation.</p>
<div id="representation" class="section level2">
<h2>Representation</h2>
<p>A complete description of typical fully-connected feed-forward <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-layer neural
network can be given in just four equations: two boundary conditions for the
input and output layers, and two recurrence relationships for the connections
between layers:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    \begin{split} 
        a^{(0)} &amp; = X \\
        z^{(i)} &amp; = W^{(i)} a^{(i-1)} + b^{(i)} \\
        a^{(i)} &amp; = \sigma(z^{(i)}) \\
        \hat{y} &amp; = a^{(L)} 
    \end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x)\)</span> is a sigmoid function, <span class="math inline">\(W^{(i)}\)</span> are matrices of weights
connecting layers, <span class="math inline">\(b^{(i)}\)</span> are bias vectors, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the given matrix of data
with one row per observation and one column per feature, and the final
activation <span class="math inline">\(a^{(L)}\)</span> is also our prediction <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>.</p>
<p>(A brief aside about notation. A superscript inside of parentheses is a <em>layer
index</em>; the parentheses are meant to distinguish it from an exponent. This
notation is used so that ordinary subscripts can be used to refer to the
individual elements of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, for example, <span class="math inline">\(W_{jk}^{(i)}\)</span> is the element
in the <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>-th row of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th column of the weight matrix <span class="math inline">\(W^{(i)}\)</span> for the
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th layer.)</p>
<p>All that’s really going on here is that we are alternating matrix
multiplication with the element-wise application of a non-linear function,
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma(x)\)</span> in this case. Start with a signal <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. To propagate the signal
through the network, multiply by a matrix <span class="math inline">\(W^{(1)}\)</span>; add in the bias, apply the
activation function. Multiply by <span class="math inline">\(W^{(2)}\)</span>, add in the bias, apply the
application function. Multiply by <span class="math inline">\(W^{(2)}\)</span>, add in the bias, apply the
application function. Repeat until you reach the output layer.</p>
<p>Note that because of the restrictions on matrix multiplication, we can determine
the number of rows and columns in each matrix <span class="math inline">\(W^{(i)}\)</span> by noting that it much have
a number of columns equal to the number of rows in <span class="math inline">\(W^{(i-1)}\)</span>. In particular
that means <span class="math inline">\(W^{(1)}\)</span> must have a number of columns equal to the number of features
in the dataset <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(W^{(L)}\)</span> has only a single output row. We call this
shared dimension the “number of nodes” in that layer of the neural network; you
will see me use this terminology in the code below especially when initializing
the network.</p>
<p>The parameters of the model are all the elements of every connection matrix
<span class="math inline">\(W^{(i)}\)</span> plus the elements of the bias vectors <span class="math inline">\(b^{(i)}\)</span>. In symbols:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \Theta = (W^{(1)} ... W^{(L)}, b^{(1)} ... b^{(L)}) \]</span></p>
<p>A quick aside about the total number of parameters: Since every element of
every weight matrix for every layer is a separate parameter, large neural
networks tend to have a <em>lot</em> of parameters. This implies that neural nets have
high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension">VC dimension</a>, which in turn implies that they tend to badly overfit
unless the number of data points in the training set is a high multiple of the
number of parameters. This is the fundamental reason why “deep neural networks”
and “big data” go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Returning to the mathematics of our representation, let’s make this abstract
recurrence relation concrete by showing explicit examples for small <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. For
example, with zero hidden layers (<span class="math inline">\(L=1\)</span>) a neural network reduces to the equation
for logistic regression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{y} =\sigma(W^{(1)} X + b^{(1)}) \]</span></p>
<p>If a zero-hidden-layer neural network is also trained with log-loss, both the
model’s representation and fitted parameters will be exactly the same as
logistic regression. We can view LR as a special case of neural nets or
equivalently neural nets as a generalization of LR.</p>
<p>With one hidden layer (<span class="math inline">\(L=2\)</span>) this expands to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{y} =\sigma(W^{(2)} \sigma(W^{(1)} X + b^{(1)}) + b^{(2)}) \]</span></p>
<p>A logistic regression of logistic regressions, if you will. As the chain grows
longer the same pattern is repeated:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \hat{y} =\sigma(W^{(3)} \sigma(W^{(2)} \sigma(W^{(1)} X + b^{(1)}) + b^{(2)}) + b^{(3)}) \]</span></p>
<p>These examples are only included for the sake of concreteness. The recursive
definitions will allow us to reason about a sequential neural network with any
number of layers.</p>
</div>
<div id="fitting" class="section level2">
<h2>Fitting</h2>
<p>To fit the model to data, we find the parameters which minimize loss:
<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\Theta} = \text{argmin} \, J(\Theta;X)\)</span>. Just as with logistic regression
we use binary cross-entropy (a.k.a. log-loss) which means our loss function <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>
is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N y_i \ln \hat{y}_i + (1-y_i) \ln (1-\hat{y}_i)
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that we have introduced a <span class="math inline">\(1/N\)</span> scale factor. We are free to do this
because multiplying by a positive constant does not change the optimization
problem. We do this so that the gradient will be an <em>average</em> over all the
training examples and therefore will be invariant w.r.t. training set size.
This turns out to be convenient because it means we will not need to change our
learning rate when fitting larger or smaller datasets.</p>
<p>One condition which must be true at a local minima is that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_\Theta J = 0\)</span>. That gives us the equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(i)}} = 0, \frac{\partial J}{\partial b^{(i)}} = 0 \]</span></p>
<p>The notation used here is from matrix calculus, and we are taking partial
derivatives with respect to a matrix (for <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>) or a vector (for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.) The
<a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf">matrix cookbook</a> may help with this notation.</p>
<p>Given the forward pass equations given above, we can easily calculate the
partial derivatives for the individual components. For the derivation of
<span class="math inline">\(\partial J / \partial a^{(L)}\)</span> you can follow pretty much the same proof
given in the <a href="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-2-logistic-regression/">previous article on logistic regression.</a> For the
others it is easy to verify from the above definitions that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    \begin{split}
        \color{blue}
        \frac{\partial J}{\partial a^{(L)}} &amp; \color{blue} = \frac{\partial J}{\partial \hat{y}} = \frac{1}{N} (y - \hat{y}) \\
        \color{green}
        \frac{\partial a^{(i)}}{\partial z^{(i)}} &amp; \color{green} = a^{(i)} \circ (1-a^{(i)}) \\
        \color{green}
        \frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial a^{(i-1)}} &amp; \color{green} = W^{(i)} \\
        \color{maroon}
        \frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial W^{(i)}} &amp; \color{maroon} = (a^{(i-1)})^T 
    \end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>For the element-wise derivative of the sigmoid we use the slightly non-obvious
fact that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma&#39;(x) = \sigma(x) (1-\sigma(x))\)</span> which we proved in <a href="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-2-logistic-regression/">Part
2</a>. Also, take special note of the transpose on the last equation! This
follows immediately from proposition (70) in the <a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf">matrix cookbook</a> but its
importance is to introduce the inner product that sums over all the training
examples; all the other terms have a number of rows equal to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (the number of
training examples) and it is only in this last step that we reduce
dimensionality to match that of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. The practical implication is that the
activations and backpropagated error terms we carry around during the
calculation require an amount of memory proportional to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. This is part of
the reason why <em>mini</em>-batch gradient descent is a good idea when training neural
networks.</p>
<p>From now on, we will be describing the equations for <span class="math inline">\(\nabla J\)</span> in terms of
partial derivatives - if you want to know how to actually calculate anything
concretely, refer to these four equations.</p>
<p>To take a partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> with respect to any parameter in any layer
we can use the chain rule. For <span class="math inline">\(W^{(L)}\)</span> we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(L)}} = 
    \Bigg(
    \color{blue}
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial a^{(L)}} \color{black} \circ
    \color{green}
    \frac{\partial a^{(L)}}{\partial z^{(L)}} \color{black} 
    \Bigg)
    \cdot
    \color{maroon}
    \frac{\partial z^{(L)}}{\partial W^{(L)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Where the dot product is defined as <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot y = (x^T y)^T\)</span>. This corresponds
to the usual definition when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are vectors but is extended to
matrices. You can think of it as summing over all the examples in the training
set. This notation isn’t 100% standard but I’m going to use it anyway because it
lets us write out the chain rule in the usual left-to-right manner.</p>
<p>Next, let’s do <span class="math inline">\(W^{(L-1)}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(L-1)}} = 
    \Bigg(
    \underbrace{
    \color{blue}
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial a^{(L)}} \color{black} \circ
    \color{green}
    \frac{\partial a^{(L)}}{\partial z^{(L)}} 
    }_{Old}
    \color{green} \circ \color{black}
    \underbrace{
    \color{green}
    \frac{\partial z^{(L)}}{\partial a^{(L-1)}} \circ
    \frac{\partial a^{(L-1)}}{\partial z^{(L-1)}} 
    }_{\text{New}}
    \color{black} \Bigg) 
    \cdot
    \color{maroon}
    \frac{\partial z^{(L-1)}}{\partial W^{(L-1)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(W^{(L-2)}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(L-2)}} = 
    \Bigg(
    \underbrace{
    \color{blue}
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial a^{(L)}} \color{black} \circ
    \color{green}
    \frac{\partial a^{(L)}}{\partial z^{(L)}} \circ
    \frac{\partial z^{(L)}}{\partial a^{(L-1)}} \circ
    \frac{\partial a^{(L-1)}}{\partial z^{(L-1)}} 
    }_{Old}
    \color{green} \circ \color{black}
    \underbrace{
    \color{green}
    \frac{\partial z^{(L-1)}}{\partial a^{(L-2)}} \circ
    \frac{\partial a^{(L-2)}}{\partial z^{(L-2)}} 
    \color{black} 
    }_{New}
    \Bigg) 
    \cdot
    \color{maroon}
    \frac{\partial z^{(L-2)}}{\partial W^{(L-2)}}
\]</span></p>
<p>By now you should be starting to see a pattern emerge: as we go back layer by layer,
the left-most part of the equation (blue and green) for layer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is always the
same as the blue and green part from layer <span class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span> plus two more new green
factors, and capped off by the final maroon factor.</p>
<p>Think of it like a snake: We always start with the (blue) derivative of our
loss function with respect to the prediction. This only happens once so stays
at the “head” of the equation. At the (maroon) “tail”, we always take a derivative
with respect to the parameters of interest. And in between we between we have a
growing (green) “body” of partial derivatives. To capture this insight
in symbols, let’s introduce a new recurrence relation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \begin{split} 
    \color{purple} \delta^{(L)} &amp; = \color{blue} \frac{\partial J}{\partial a^{(L)}} \color{black} \circ \color{green} \frac{\partial a^{(L)}}{\partial z^{(L)}} \color{black} \\
    \color{purple} \delta^{(i-1)} &amp; = \color{purple} \delta^{(i)} \color{black} \circ \Bigg( \color{green} \frac{\partial z^{(i)}}{\partial a^{(i-1)}} \circ \frac{\partial a^{(i-1)}}{\partial z^{(i-1)}} \color{black} \Bigg) \\
    \frac{\partial J}{\partial W^{(i)}} &amp; = \color{purple} \delta^{(i)} \color{black} \circ \color{maroon} \frac{\partial z^{(L-2)}}{\partial W^{(L-2)}}
    \end{split}
\]</span></p>
<p>It should also be clear that we can implement this iteratively if we start at
layer <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> and work backwards: If we save the result of the blue and green parts
from layer <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, we can add on another pair of green partial derivates to grow
the “body” and quickly compute layer <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span>. Note also that in order to
calculate <span class="math inline">\(\color{green} \partial a / \partial z\)</span> we need to know the
activations which are most easily obtained by first performing a forward pass
and remembering the activations for use in the backwards pass.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to point out that the justification for introducing the
(technically extraneous) concept of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is found in how absolutely obvious and
clear it makes the separate steps of the forward and backwards pass. If we had
to take <span class="math inline">\(\partial a^{(i)} / \partial a^{(i-1)}\)</span> directly without going through
<span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> we would have to think about a non-linear function of a matrix all at once;
with <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> we’re able to view it as the element-wise application of a non-linear
function (which is Calculus 101) and the partial derivative of a linear
expression with respect to a matrix (which is Matrix Calculus 101; see the
<a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf">Cookbook</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="implementation" class="section level2">
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The above equations are straight-forward to turn into working code. The only
wrinkle is that while above we represented the bias as separate vectors
<span class="math inline">\(b^{(i)}\)</span>, in the implementation we will instead implement the bias by assuring
that the matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and all intermediate activations <span class="math inline">\(a^{(i)}\)</span> have a constant
1 in their first column. Thus, in the Python implementation the first column of
each <span class="math inline">\(W^{(i)}\)</span> plays the role of the bias vector. This simplifies the code in
some ways but complicates it in others; pay attention to where we are stacking
the bias node (or removing it during the backwards pass) and the apparent
off-by-one “mismatch” in matrix dimensions this introduces.</p>

<p>Initializing a neural network correctly turns out to be very important. If we
punt and simply initialize all weights to a constant, the network will flat out
not work to any meaningful degree. That’s new; linear regression and logistic
regression certainly didn’t exhibit that behavior. Why is this the case?
Well, if all the weights in a given layer are exactly the same at iteration
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, then the backpropagated error for each node with be exactly the same, so
the gradient descent update will be exactly the same, so all the weights in the
layer at iteration <span class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span> will be exactly the same. By induction, this will be
true for all iterations. Because all the weights of given layer are constrained
to be the same, we effectively have only one free parameter! Our model will
never learn the complex representations we want it to. Luckily, this critical
point is almost surely unstable, so we can break symmetry by simply
initializing the weights slightly differently. There are a couple popular ways
to do this (one due to <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf">Glorot and Bengio</a> and another due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852v1.pdf">He et
al.</a>) but since I don’t claim to understand either of those in great
detail, to conform with the constraints of the “from scratch” project I’ll do
something I <em>do</em> understand and just randomly initialize them randomly
distributed by <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1^2)\)</span>. That suffices to break symmetry.</p>
<pre><code>    def _random_initialization(self):
        # a small amount of randomization is necessary to
        # break symmetry; otherwise all hidden layers would
        # get updated in lockstep.
        if not self.n_hidden:
            layer_sizes = [ (self.n_output, self.n_input+1) ]
        else:
            layer_sizes = [ (self.n_hidden[0], self.n_input+1) ]
            previous_size = self.n_hidden[0]

            for size in self.n_hidden[1:]:
                layer_sizes.append( (size, previous_size+1) )
                previous_size = size

            layer_sizes.append( (self.n_output, previous_size+1) )
        
        self.layers = [
            [np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=layer_size), sigmoid]
            for layer_size in layer_sizes
        ]</code></pre>
<p>Fitting is straight-forward: for every iteration we do one forward-pass to
calculated activations, then one backwards pass to calculated gradients and
update all the weights. You may notice that we’ve reverted to batch gradient
descent; today’s focus is on the representation of neural networks and the
backpropagation algorithm, so we’ll keep everything else as simple as possible.
You can read about more sophisticated gradient descent methods in the <a href="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-2-logistic-regression/">previous
article in this series.</a></p>

<p>The forward pass follows our above recursive definition of the neural network
very closely. We initialize activation with the given predictors <span class="math inline">\(a^{(0)} = X\)</span>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Real world data are messy. Instead of shopping around for a toy data set which
exhibits all the properties we want, we’ll cook up an idealized data set that
is designed to only be solvable by a non-linear classifier.</p>
<pre><code>from sklearn import datasets

X_full, y_full = datasets.make_classification(
    n_samples=5000, n_features=20,
    n_informative=15,
    n_redundant=3,

y_train = y_full[:train_test_split]
X_test = X_full[train_test_split:, :]
y_test = y_full[train_test_split:]</code></pre>
<p>This synthetic dataset has 4,000 examples in the training set and 1,000 in the
test set. There are two classes with equal prevalence. There are 20 features,
but only about half of these have non-zero mutual information with the class.
5% of examples simply have their class flipped, so the Bayes rate will be less
than 0.05; in other words, the ceiling for accuracy is less than 95%. Each
vertex is assigned to one class or the other and then data is sampled from a
standard multivariate Gaussian distribution centered at each vertex. In
particular, because vertices are only one standard deviation away from each
other these distributions will overlap a good deal and further reduce the Bayes
rate. The problem is highly non-linear and classifiers with linear decision
boundaries will struggle; however it not at all pathological and a good
non-linear classifier should be able to achieve something quite close to the
Bayes rate.</p>
<p>When we fit a model, the number of hidden layers and the node of nodes
in each layer is a hyperparameter. For example, two hidden layers with
20 nodes in the first layer and 5 in the second would be <code>[20, 5]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>nn = NeuralNetwork(n_hidden=[8, 3], max_iter=2000)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_hat = nn.predict(X_train)
p_hat = nn.predict_proba(X_train)
np.mean(y_train == y_hat)</code></pre>
<p>If we have no hidden layers at all then our neural network reduces to logistic
regression. In particular that means it can only learn an linear decision
boundary. How well does that do on the synthetic dataset we cooked up?</p>
<pre><code>nn = NeuralNetwork(n_hidden=[], max_iter=2000)
nn.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_hat = nn.predict(X_train)
p_hat = nn.predict_proba(X_train)
y_test_hat = nn.predict(X_test)
p_test_hat = nn.predict_proba(X_test)

<p>Not so hot: about 72% accuracy, and an AUC of 0.7866. That’s pretty far away from
the Bayes rate we estimated above; therefore we are probably underfitting.</p>

<p>On the other extreme, after trying a couple of hyperparameters, I found that
<code>[8,3]</code> worked reasonably well.</p>
<pre><code>nn = NeuralNetwork(n_hidden=[8, 3], max_iter=2000)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-3-backpropagation_files/roc_8_3.png" alt="ROC Curve for trivial NN" />
<p class="caption">ROC Curve for trivial NN</p>
</div>
<p>The <code>[8, 3]</code> model achieves 0.96 AUC and 95% accuracy on the training set and
91% accuracy on the test set. This is enormously better than what was possible
with a linear decision boundary.</p>
<p>This new model has two hidden layers of 8 nodes and 3 nodes respectively; all
layers are fully connected, so there’s a <span class="math inline">\(9 \times 3\)</span> matrix with 27 parameters
connecting them, plus the <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 1\)</span> connecting to the output node and the
<span class="math inline">\(21 \times 8\)</span> matrix connecting to the input layer, making for 199 parameters
in all. Therefore it’s no surprise that its able to fit the training set much
more closely, but it is very pleasant surprise that this means its test set
performance is also much improved!</p>
<p>We can get a better intuition for the relationship between the complexity of
our neural network and performance by plotting test set AUC as a function of
the number of node used:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/ml-from-scratch-part-3-backpropagation_files/test_auc_by_number_of_nodes_layers.png" alt="ROC Curve for trivial NN" />
<p class="caption">ROC Curve for trivial NN</p>
</div>
<p>There’s a clear elbow in the graph around 10 nodes. Below that, the model
makes steady gain in performance as more nodes to the model and its representation
becomes better equipped to deal with the non-linearity of the true distribution.
Above 10 nodes, making the model more complex is not able to further reduce
generalization error; This suggests that the <code>[8,3]</code> model we found earlier is
about as good as we can do.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the more data available for training, the more features,
and the more non-linear/interaction effects in the true population, the more
that elbow gets pushed to the right; in other words, The model doesn’t start to
overfit until much later. For best results, the complexity of the neural
network should mirror the complexity of the underlying problem. One advantage
of neural networks is that they give us an easy way to make the model
arbitrarily “smarter” simply by adding more layers and more neurons. In
fact, not only can we simply throw more neurons and layers at a problem,
we also have a wide variety of specialized layers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">CNNs</a> which
can make a neural network more suited to a particular problem. The neural
network is a very “modular” learning algorithm in this sense and the flexibility
means in can be adapted to a wide variety of problems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the strategy of bigger, smarter neural networks is only really
viable when we have a ton of training data. Smart neural networks trained on
small datasets overfit horribly long before they learn to generalize. Neural
networks don’t solve the bias-variance trade-off for us, and they certainly
aren’t a free lunch. But they do provide a framework for creating models with
low bias even on very large and difficult problems… then it’s our job to keep
the variance in check.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That was backpropagation from scratch, our first look at neural networks. We
saw how a sequential feed-forward network could be represented as alternating
linear and non-linear transforms. We saw how to use the chain rule to calculate
the gradient of the loss function with respect to any parameter in any layer of
model, and how to calculate these gradients efficiently using the
backpropagation algorithm. We demonstrated that a neural network could solve
non-linear classification problems that logistic regression struggled with. And
finally we saw how we could tune the number of layers and nodes in the neural
network to take advantage of large datasets.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">specific neural network</a> presented in this article is incredibly simple
relative to the neural networks used to solve real world problems. For example,
we haven’t yet talked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem">vanishing gradient problem</a> and how it
can be solved with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)">rectified linear units</a> or <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/batch-normalization-in-neural-networks-1ac91516821c">batch normalization</a>,
how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">convolutional layers</a> or <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/#pool">pooling</a> can help when the data have a
natural spatial structure, how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">residual networks</a> wire layers together as
acyclic digraphs, how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">recurrent neural networks</a> use short-term memory to
handle arbitrary sequences of inputs, or a thousand other topics. Yet today,
the state-of-the-art algorithm used to train all of these varied species of neural
networks is backpropagation, exactly as presented here.</p>
<p>In practice, it isn’t usually necessary to actually do the calculus by hand.
Modern machine learning frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/eager/automatic_differentiation">Tensorflow</a> or <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html">PyTorch</a>
prominently feature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a> as a core capability. The chain
rule is straightforward to apply mechanically - the hard part is keeping track
of all those indices! So it makes sense to have software handle it.</p>
<p>In the next installment of the <a href="/tags/from-scratch/">Machine Learning From Scratch series</a>
(coming soon!) we will change tact and look at a completely different approach
to non-linear classification: decision trees and the recursive partition
algorithm. We will see how these two apparently diametrically opposed
approaches can both be viewed as examples of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-adaptive-basis-functions">adaptive basis functions</a>,
and how this point-of-view unifies disparate topics in machine learning.</p>
