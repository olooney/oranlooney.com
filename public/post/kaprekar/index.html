<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprekar%27s_routine">Kaprekar&rsquo;s routine</a> is a simple arithmetic procedure which, when applied
to four digit numbers, rapidly converges to the fixed point 6174, known as the
Kaprekar constant. Unlike other famous iterative procedures such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz function</a>, the somewhat arbitrary nature of the Kaprekar routine
doesn&rsquo;t hint at fundamental mathematical discoveries yet to be made; rather, its
charm lies in its intuitive definition (requiring no more than elementary
mathematics,) its oddly off-center fixed point of 6174, and its surprisingly rapid
convergence (which requires only five iterations on average and never more than
seven.)</p>

<p>The routine itself is simple. Given a four digit number, say 8352, we first
place the digits in descending order to obtain a larger 4-digit number (8532)
and then in ascending order to obtain a smaller 4-digit number (2358) and then
subtract the smaller from the larger to obtain the result. (8532-2358 = 6174).
This represents one iteration in the routine. The process is repeated until the
output is the same as the input, at which point we can stop, because we have
reached the fixed point and the same result will recur endlessly.</p>

<p>There are two edge cases to consider. In order for the procedure to work
correctly, we need to treat numbers less than 100 (and which therefore have
three or fewer digits when written normally) as if they indeed had four digits
and were padded with leading zeros. For example, we would treat the number 42
as having the four digits &ldquo;0042&rdquo; and take 4200 - 0024 to obtain 4176. Also, if
the Kaprekar procedure is applied to numbers with all the same digits, such as
5555, then the result would be zero, which is inconvenient. For that reason, we
exclude such numbers from the domain, and simply say that the function is
undefined on them.</p>

<p>All of this can be succinctly and exactly expressed in a few lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>def sort_digits(n: int, length: int) -&gt; str:
    return ''.join(sorted(str(n).zfill(length)))


def k(n: int, length: int = 4) -&gt; int:
    ascending = sort_digits(n, length)
    descending = ascending[::-1]
    return int(descending) - int(ascending)


def kaprekar(n, length: int = 4) -&gt; tuple[int, int]:
    i = 0
    while True:
        m = k(n, length)
        if m == n:
            return i, m
        i = i+1
        n = m
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>k(n)</code> computes one iteration of the routine and returns the next
number in the series, while <code>kaprekar(n)</code> returns both the number of iterations
it takes to reach the fixed point and the value of the fixed point itself as a
pair; for example, <code>(5, 6174)</code> means &ldquo;reached the fixed point 6174 after 5
iterations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Implementing Kaprekar is easy. Showing that every valid four digit number
reaches the fixed point 6174 is computationally trivial given there are only
9,990 such numbers. Explaining why it should have a unique fixed point and why
the convergence is so rapid is not so simple. For example, it would be entirely
plausible for it to converge to a cycle, oscillating forever between two or
more values for ever, or for it to converge to one of several distinct fixed
points or cycles depending on the starting number.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also not clear why the convergence should be <em>so</em> rapid: if each iteration
cut down the number of surviving numbers by half, it would still take about 13
iterations to collapse to a single value. In that sense, Kaprekar converges
&ldquo;surprisingly&rdquo; quickly.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can say anything interesting about the nature of the
convergence. We&rsquo;ll use data visualization to develop intuition and formulate
hypotheses, then write simple programs to validate them.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-iterations">Number of Iterations</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with a simple histogram:</p>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/histogram.png"></p>

<p>Most numbers are &ldquo;far&rdquo; from the fixed-point and require many iterations
to reach it.</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s try to get a sense of how rapid convergence is. We start with the
full pool of 9,990 distinct valid numbers, and for each iteration we plot
(using a log scale) how many unique numbers remain after $k$ iterations:</p>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/convergence.png"></p>

<p>This graph also shows the number of unique &ldquo;sorted&rdquo; values, where &ldquo;sorted&rdquo;
means that the digits of the number where sorted. It is possible to think of
the Kaprekar routine as two separate steps: it first sorts the digits of the
number, then it differences it with its reverse. That means that it essentially
ignores the original order of digits; any two numbers with the same set of
digits, regardless of order, will necessarily have the same result. Numbers
like 4277, 2477, 7427, and 7274 will all map the same number. The digit sorting
step is responsible for the lions share of collisions; in fact, we can see that
in the very first iteration it has already reduced the set of valid numbers
from 9,990 to 705 - reducing the pool by 97%.</p>

<p>However, the second step, differencing with the reverse, is also responsible
for a large number of collapses. After the first differencing step, we&rsquo;ve gone
from 705 unique sorted values to only 54, reducing the total pool of survivors
by another 92%. Taken together, these eliminate 99.5% of all unique values in
the first iteration alone.</p>

<p>After that, convergence slows considerably. The slope on the log scale plot is
about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, which means that each subsequent iteration cuts the pool of unique
numbers roughly in half.</p>

<p>The above visualizations are good high level summaries but we want to
investigate the structure in more detail, ideally all the way down to the
individual numbers. To visualize all numbers up to 9999 on a single graph, we
take the first two digits as the x coordinate and the last two digits as the y
coordinate and plot them on a 100x100 grid. (I didn&rsquo;t invent this - it seems to
be quite a common way to visualize the Kaprekar routine, although I&rsquo;m not sure
where it originated.)</p>

<pre><code># reshape counts into a 2D grid
data = np.array([0] + kaprekar_iteration_counts(4))  
reshaped_data = data.reshape((100, 100))

# plot the grid
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.imshow(reshaped_data, cmap='coolwarm', vmin=0, vmax=7, aspect='equal')
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/n_iterations.png"></p>

<p>An interesting structure emerges: there are many diagonal streaks that share
the exact same color. Is there something about two points being diagonal
neighbors in this 100x100 space that makes them more likely to collapse?</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-convergence">Structure of Convergence</h2>

<p>Another way to use the 100x100 grid is to assign a color to every unique number
after $k$ iterations. If two pixels have the same color, we know they will
collide in $k$ iterations or fewer.</p>

<p>First iteration:</p>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/frame_1.png"></p>

<p>See if you can mentally visualize this in four dimensions by first stacking
all the cells in a row to get a 3D shape, then again for each columns to get
a 4D shape. You should see a kind of 4-dimensional blue football with red
around the corners. Numbers where all four digits are similar (like 4445) map to low
numbers (like 0999), while numbers with dissimilar digits (like 0009) map to high
numbers (like 8991.)</p>

<p>To avoid duplicating this visual seven times, I&rsquo;ve compressed it into an
animation:</p>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/animation.gif"></p>

<p>This allows us to see collapses occurring with each iteration and observe the
complex but obviously non-random structure that emerges. (The static images
for each iteration are available in the <a href="/post/kaprekar_files/Kaprekar.html">Jupyter notebook</a>.)</p>

<p>The diagonal structure we notice above seems prominent in this visualization as
well; in fact, it seems to get even more pronounced as the number of iterations
increases. What is going on there?</p>

<p>While the 100x100 is good for getting a gestalt impression of the whole, it&rsquo;s
hard to read off individual transitions or trace the orbits of individual
numbers through the iteration. For a more detailed deep dive, we can use
<a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> to visualize the exact structure of collapses. To avoid
overwhelming the visualization, let&rsquo;s only show the 54 unique numbers that
survive the first iteration:</p>

<pre><code># Initialize the unique colors set and the arrows set
unique_colors = set()
arrows = set()

# Generate the 'ukx' array with unique Kaprekar values
ukx = np.unique([k(x, 4) for x in range(1, 10000) if not identical_digits(x, 4)])

for x in ukx:
    color_number = sort_digits(x, 4)
    color = color_map[color_number]
    arrows.add(f'{x} [fillcolor=&quot;{color}&quot;, style=filled]')
    arrows.add(f'{x} -&gt; {k(x)}')

# Create and print the graph definition
print('digraph G {')
for arrow in arrows:
    print('   ', arrow)
print('}')
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/kaprekar_graph_colored.png"></p>

<p>On this graph, each number is a node, and you can follow the arrow to see where
the Kaprekar function sends that number. The nodes are color-coded according to
their sorted digits, so any two numbers which are the same modulo the digit
sorting operation will be the same color. That makes it obvious that digit
sorting is still responsible for a large number of collapses. For example, we
can see that 7623, 3267, and 7263 (shown in light green) all map to 5265, and
that is entirely due to them have the same set of digits, just in a different
order.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the collapses which are <em>not</em> due to digit sorting which are really
fascinating, though. Why do 7173 and 8262 collapse together, for example?
If you look closely, these numbers do have a relationship; each digit is
different by exactly 1:</p>

<table style="max-width: 50%; margin: auto; font-size: 120%;">
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">7173</th>
<th align="center">8262</th>
<th align="center">Difference</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="center">7</td>
<td align="center">8</td>
<td align="center">+1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">+1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">7</td>
<td align="center">6</td>
<td align="center">-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">-1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This same pattern occurs in many other places on the graph as well. That
can&rsquo;t be a coincidence, can it?</p>

<p>Recall the diagonal patters that characterized the above 100x100 visualization.
What does it mean for two points to be &ldquo;diagonal neighbors&rdquo; on that visualization?
Doesn&rsquo;t that also mean some of their digits also differ by only 1?</p>

<h2 id="diagonal-structure">Diagonal Structure</h2>

<p>The diagonal streaks in the above suggest something about the structure.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you add one to both the largest and smallest digit. After you
apply the Kaprekar procedure, that &ldquo;+1&rdquo; will cancel out, because the largest
and smallest digits will be aligned by the process of flipping the digits
around. Thus, we should expect the result of k() to be the same.</p>

<pre><code>def are_diagonal(x, y, length=4) -&gt; bool:
    if length != 4:
        raise NotImplementedError(&quot;only implemented for length=4 so far.&quot;)

    # Sort the digits of each number
    sorted_x = sort_digits(x, length=length)
    sorted_y = sort_digits(y, length=length)

    # Compute the differences between the sorted digits
    differences = [int(b) - int(a) for a, b in zip(sorted_x, sorted_y)]
    for d in differences:
        if abs(d) != 1:
            return False

    return all([ d1 == d2 for (d1, d2) in zip(differences, differences[::-1]) ])
</code></pre>

<p>We can implement a proof by exhaustion to empirically verify this insight:</p>

<pre><code>count_misses = 0
count_hits = 0
neighbors = []

for z in sorted_valid_numbers:
    kz = k(z)
    for w in sorted_valid_numbers:
        if w &lt; z and are_diagonal(z, w):
            kw = k(w)

            neighbors.append({ 'z': z, 'w': w, 'k(z)': kz, 'k(w)': kw })
            if kz != kw:
                print(f'z={z} w={w} k(z)={kz} k(w)={kw}')
                count_misses += 1
            else:
                count_hits += 1

print(f'hits: {count_hits}, misses: {count_misses}')
neighbors_df = pd.DataFrame(neighbors)
</code></pre>

<p>This verifies this theorem for us - if two numbers are diagonal neighbors, then
the Kaprekar is guaranteed to send them to the same value, causing a collision.</p>

<h2 id="collisions">Collisions</h2>

<p>There are two main mechanisms for collisions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Digit Sorting</li>
<li>Diagonal Neighbors</li>
</ol>

<p>There are also many &ldquo;random&rdquo; collisions on the first iteration. However, after
the first iteration, <em>every</em> collision is explained by one of those two
mechanisms, as you can verify yourself from the graph above.</p>

<p>I think this explains the extraordinary rapid convergence on the sequence -
there are two distinct and common ways to have a collision between any two
numbers, so a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Birthday problem</a> style argument all but guarantees that
there will be collisions in any larger set of numbers.</p>

<p>This kind of pseudo-probabilistic argument doesn&rsquo;t offer any guarantees of
course. There is a still an element of chance, especially in the last few
iterations. We know this because if we look at variants of the problem
(different number of digits than 4, bases other than base-10) then we often
find there is not a unique fixed point. But it does make it much less
surprising that it should rapidly converge.</p>

<p>Is there any deep reason why there is a unique fixed point for 4-digit
base-10 numbers? The fact that other variants ($n$-digits base-$m$ numbers)
often have cycles suggest not. In fact, it&rsquo;s more like a weak anthropic
principle - the only reason this particular combination caught Kaprekar&rsquo;s
attention is because it <em>does</em> happen to have a unique fixed point,
while (for example) 3 or 5 digit numbers are ignored.</p>

<p>Why is the fixed point 6174? I originally thought there was some significance
to the fact that this was quite close to the average $k(n)$ - that is to say,
if you choose a random number $n$ uniformly between 1 and 9999, and calculate
$k(n)$, then the expected value is 6108 - quite close to the fixed point. This
is fairly intuitive when you consider that sorting the digits of a number in
descending order tends to increase it (to about 8054 on average) and sorting
them ascending tends to decrease it (to an average of 1946) And the Kaprekar
routine takes the average of these two (which is where 6108 comes from.)</p>

<p><img src="/post/kaprekar_files/convergence_table.png"></p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s no real evidence of the Kaprekar routine converging to
this mean or really even narrowing significantly across iterations, except
by the inevitable winnowing as the number of unique values decreases
as collisions occur. (If you select a finite sample from a uniform distribution
and calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)">range</a>, it will on average be smaller than the width
of the original distribution; range is an <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/391612/mle-of-fx-vert-theta-1-theta-x-1-cdots-x-n-sim-u0-theta-t/391637#391637">optimal</a> but biased estimator
of the width of a uniformly distributed random variable.) It jumps up and
down all over the place and the fact that it happens to end up quite close
to the mean feels more like luck than any kind of convergence - insofar
&ldquo;luck&rdquo; has any meaning for a deterministic process.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The observation that &ldquo;diagonal neighbors&rdquo; is the primary mechanism for
collapses (other than digit sorting, obviously) is interesting, and it arose
directly from doing the 100x100 grids and interpreting the patterns found there.
The animation showing unique values collapsing it attractive and eye-catching
but hard to interpret. The color-coded graph showing individual transitions
is complex but rewards close study and the &ldquo;diagonal neighbor&rdquo; structure is even
more apparent on this graph than on the 100x100 views.</p>
