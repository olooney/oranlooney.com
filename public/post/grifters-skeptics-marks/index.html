<p>We are in a golden age of grift. Where adventurers once flocked to California
or the Yukon because &ldquo;there was gold in them thar hills,&rdquo; the fastest way to
get rich today is by fleecing suckers. We&rsquo;ve got crypto rug pulls, meme stocks,
nutritional supplements, MLMs&mdash;anything to make a quick buck.</p>

<p>Fraud is hardly a new phenomenon. The Great Depression brought with it a wave
of con artists, mythologized in movies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Moon_(film)"><em>Paper Moon</em></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sting"><em>The
Sting</em></a>. A century earlier, Mark Twain wrote about the innumerable
swindlers and card sharps operating along the Mississippi River; indeed, Twain
himself lost most of his fortune in <a href="https://time.com/4297572/mark-twain-bad-business/">fraudulent investment schemes</a>.
Medievalist Umberto Eco wrote several novels exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prague_Cemetery">frauds</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudolino">liars</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_the_Day_Before">magical thinkers</a> in the Middle Ages. Such men thrived
thanks to superstition and poor record keeping.</p>

<p><img src="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/baudolino_book_cover.jpg" alt="Baudolino Book Cover" /></p>

<p>Is the current boom the new normal? The start of a slide into a new post-truth
dark age? Or are we simply experiencing yet another high watermark in a cycle
as old as civilization? If it is cyclic, is it driven by external circumstances
such as war or poverty, or does it arise naturally from the dynamics of the
system?</p>

<p>The answer, I&rsquo;d argue, lies in a moderately obscure mathematical theory from
the 1980s.</p>

<h2 id="evolutionary-game-theory">Evolutionary Game Theory</h2>

<p>The version of game theory most people have seen is the rational-agent sort:
perfectly informed players maximize utility, best responses snap into place,
and equilibria have the clean finality of a solved puzzle. Evolutionary Game
Theory (EGT) is different. It assumes that all strategies exist in the
population and that success in games slowly increases the relative proportion
of that strategy in the population over time. Strategies that earn higher
payoffs become more common. Strategies that earn lower payoffs decline.</p>

<p>This is the framework John Maynard Smith popularized in <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/686059918/Evolution-and-the-Theory-of-Games-PDFDrive"><em>Evolution and the
Theory of Games</em></a>. The book is now mostly read by specialists, but it
contains a small number of ideas that are so widely applicable that once you
know about them, you start seeing them everywhere.</p>

<p><img src="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/etg_book_cover.jpg" alt="Evolutionary Game Theory Book Cover" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to tackle the problem of understanding the cycle of grift by proposing
a novel EGT model. The model is similar to the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory#Hawk_dove">Hawks, Doves, &amp;
Retaliator</a> model (which I&rsquo;ll come back to later) but has a different
payoff matrix that leads to very different dynamics.</p>

<h2 id="the-gsm-model">The GSM Model</h2>

<p>To define our model, we&rsquo;ll choose three strategies, specify the payoff matrix
which describes what happens when two strategies interact, then use the
mathematical tools of EGT to study that model. The three strategies are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grifter</strong>: attempts exploitation when possible.</li>
<li><strong>Skeptic</strong>: pays an ongoing cost to avoid being exploited.</li>
<li><strong>Mark</strong>: trusts by default; cooperates cheaply, but is vulnerable.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can formalize these strategies within EGT by defining a payoff matrix:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Players</th>
<th>Grifter</th>
<th>Skeptic</th>
<th>Mark</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Grifter</strong></td>
<td>-grifter_loss</td>
<td>-grifter_loss</td>
<td>grift_gain</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Skeptic</strong></td>
<td>-skeptic_cost</td>
<td>mutual_benefit - skeptic_cost</td>
<td>mutual_benefit - skeptic_cost</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Mark</strong></td>
<td>-mark_loss</td>
<td>mutual_benefit</td>
<td>mutual_benefit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>When a Grifter meets another Grifter or a Skeptic, the scam fails. The Grifter
wastes time and effort and incurs a loss. Only when a Grifter meets a Mark does
the strategy pay off: the Grifter successfully exploits the Mark and gains a
sizable reward.</p>

<p>A Skeptic can avoid getting scammed, but pays a constant price for vigilance,
which represents the cost of investing in education and doing due diligence.
When interacting with honest players (Skeptics or Marks), they still achieve
mutual cooperation, but still have to pay the cost for their caution. However,
when interacting with a Grifter, they&rsquo;re able to walk away from the deal early,
losing only the constant cost of skepticism.</p>

<p>In contrast, a Mark is trusting and unguarded. When a Mark meets another Mark,
everything goes smoothly: they cooperate without hesitation and both receive
maximal payoffs. Things go almost as well when they meet a Skeptic; after the
Skeptic has done their homework the two are able to cooperate without issue,
and the Mark still receives a maximal payoff.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only when a Mark encounters a Grifter that things go south. When that
happens, the Mark gets exploited and incurs a large loss.</p>

<p>The specific parameters don&rsquo;t affect the qualitative outcome much, but here are
some reasonable parameter values for concreteness:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>parameter_name</th>
      <th>value</th>
      <th colspan="2">note</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>mutual_benefit</td>
      <td>1.0</td>
      <td colspan="2">mutual benefit of cooperation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>skeptic_cost</td>
      <td>0.2</td>
      <td colspan="2">overhead of being a skeptic</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>grift_gain</td>
      <td>1.5</td>
      <td colspan="2">payoff for a Grifter exploiting a Mark</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mark_loss</td>
      <td>2.0</td>
      <td colspan="2">loss suffered by a Mark when exploited</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>grifter_loss</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
      <td colspan="2">cost of a failed grift</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>With those parameters, the concrete payoff matrix is:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Players</th>
<th>Grifter</th>
<th>Skeptic</th>
<th>Mark</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Grifter</strong></td>
<td>-0.5</td>
<td>-0.5</td>
<td>1.5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Skeptic</strong></td>
<td>-0.2</td>
<td>0.8</td>
<td>0.8</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>Mark</strong></td>
<td>-2.0</td>
<td>1.0</td>
<td>1.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="replicator-dynamics">Replicator Dynamics</h2>

<p>To turn payoffs into population dynamics, we use replicator equations: each
strategy grows (or shrinks) in proportion to how well it is doing relative to
the population average.</p>

<p>Here is the simple, discrete-time simulator I used:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">def replicator(populations, A, delta=0.05, N=2000):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Given an initial vector of `populations`, a payoff matrix `A`, a step size
    `delta`, and a number of iterations `N`, return the trajectory as a 2D
    numpy matrix and the final population as a 1D numpy array the same shape as
    the population.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # ensure populations is a normalized numpy vector
    populations = np.asarray(populations, float)
    populations = populations / populations.sum()

    # initialize the trajectory with the initial conditions
    trajectory = [populations.copy()]
    
    for _ in range(N):
        # payoff for this iteration
        fitness = A @ populations 

        # update population in direction of the most successful strategy
        average = populations @ fitness
        populations = populations + delta * (populations * (fitness - average))

        # avoid extinction and normalize
        populations = np.clip(populations, 1e-6, 1 + delta) 
        populations = populations / populations.sum()
        
        # track the full history of population trajectories
        trajectory.append(populations.copy())

    return np.array(trajectory), populations
</code></pre>

<p>The full source code is available as a <a href="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/grifters-skeptics-marks.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>. It
even has a cell with interactive widgets so you can play around with the
parameters in real time.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The state of a three-strategy population fits naturally on a simplex: a
triangle where each corner is a pure population (100% Grifter, 100% Skeptic,
100% Mark), and each interior point is a mixture. Several different trajectories
are shown as colored fields, each with different random initial conditions, and
a vector field showing the evolutionary pressure at each point is overlaid.</p>

<p><img src="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/cannonical_gsm.png" alt="GSM Simplex" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s immediately obvious that each trajectory spirals outward until it
is following a roughly triangular orbit which visits each corner in turn, almost
reaching it before it starts to curve dramatically towards the next.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also instructive to look at the longitudinal view, plotting the three
populations as a time series:</p>

<p><img src="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/cannonical_gsm_ts.png" alt="GSM Time Series" /></p>

<p>Taking these two visualizations together, we can see the system does not settle
down to a single equilibrium point but instead falls into quasi-periodic
cycles. Each strategy takes a turn dominating, but inevitably falls to the
strategy which it is weak to. This is a signature of &ldquo;non-transitive&rdquo; games
such as rock-paper-scissors; in such games trajectories orbit rather than
converge.</p>

<p>Our game is &ldquo;non-transitive&rdquo; because success is a function of the current
population mix, and that very success always leads to a <em>different</em> mix:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marks prosper when grifters are rare, because trust is efficient.</li>
<li>Grifters prosper when marks are common, because exploitation is easy.</li>
<li>Skeptics prosper when grifters are common, because vigilance pays for itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>In models like this, a few different long-run patterns are possible: the system
might converge to one stable balance (a fixed-point attractor), it might circle
around in a stable loop (a limit cycle), or it might swing closer and closer to
each corner in turn, spending long stretches dominated by one strategy before
shifting again (a heteroclinic cycle). The qualitative behavior is roughly the
same, though: periodic cycles, not a steady state.</p>

<h2 id="hawks-doves-and-retaliators">Hawks, Doves, and Retaliators</h2>

<p>A useful contrast is the classic Hawks, Doves, &amp; Retaliators model, which is often
used as a first EGT example because it tends to settle to a stable equilibrium
point. Here is the same simulation run using the HDR payoff matrix:</p>

<p><img src="/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/hdr.png" alt="HDR Simplex" /></p>

<p>No orbits here: instead, all trajectories converge to a single point at a 60-40
split between Hawks and Doves, with Retaliators going extinct. Such a stable
equilibrium point is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy">evolutionarily stable strategy</a> (ESS).</p>

<p>Why does HDR converge to an ESS while GSM does not? The Retaliator strategy goes
extinct and stays extinct because it bears the full cost of policing Hawks
itself. In contrast, the Skeptic in GSM is not concerned with punishing
Grifters but simply avoiding them.</p>

<!--
Cost of Skepticism
------------------

It is possible for the GSM model to collapse to an ESS equilibrium if
we make the constant cost of skepticism (which you'll remember represents the
overhead of education and conducting due diligence before deals) too high:

![GSM High Skeptic Cost Simplex](/post/grifters-skeptics-marks_files/high_skeptic_cost_gsm.png)

Such a model basically collapses to feudalism, with an underclass permanently
exploited by an aristocracy, which is only limited in size by its frequent
destructive conflicts with itself.

However, as long as the cost of skepticism isn't prohibitive, it remains
a competitive strategy.
-->

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you believe the assumptions of the model, the implications are clear.
Grift is cyclical, and any period of high grift will soon give way to a period
of high skepticism, which will last until enough time has passed for people to
once again forget the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned. In concrete terms, the current
generation of grifters is putting on a masterclass in spotting con artists and
it won&rsquo;t be long before their tricks are well known, at which point they&rsquo;ll
stop working. Consider NFTs, which crashed pretty hard once people saw through
them.</p>

<p>OK then, <em>should</em> you believe the model? On one hand, obviously not. It&rsquo;s a
ridiculously simplified caricature of human behavior and every aspect of the
model can be legitimately challenged. In some ways we can say it is definitely
wrong: for example, it has the various populations crashing to near zero with
each period, whereas in the real world the change is more a matter of degree.
On the other hand, sometimes very simple toy models <em>do</em> somehow capture the
essence of a phenomenon. &ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful,&rdquo; to quote
George Box. If nothing else, I think this model shows that a certain
fluctuation in the number of con artists arises naturally from the dynamics of
the system without the need for any external drivers as the general populace
gradually forgets and then is forced to relearn how to protect themselves from
various scams.</p>

<p>In terms of concrete predictions, that depends on whether or not you think
we&rsquo;ve reached &ldquo;peak grift&rdquo; or not. I think we have, and that we should
therefore anticipate more skepticism in the near future with a corresponding
lack of success from grifters. Perhaps that&rsquo;s naïve.</p>
