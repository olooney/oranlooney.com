<p>How good are LLMs at trivia? I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindram11/jeopardy-dataset-updated">Jeopardy! dataset</a> from Kaggle to
benchmark ChatGPT and the new LLama3 models.  Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/benchmark7.png"></p>

<p>There you go. You&rsquo;ve already gotten 90% of what you&rsquo;re going to get out of this
article.  Some guy on the internet ran a half-baked benchmark on a scattered
handful of LLM models and approaches, and those results are largely in line with
<a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/">popular benchmarks</a> and received wisdom on fine-tuning and RAG.</p>

<p>Still, the process was interesting, so I&rsquo;m going to talk about it. At length.
You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt">code</a> for this article is available on GitHub.</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have my own point-of-view on Llama3 vs. ChatGPT.</li>
<li>Demonstrate fine-tuning has a measurable benefit.</li>
<li>Demonstrate RAG has a measurable benefit.</li>
<li>Have fun and pay homage to Jeopardy!, the greatest trivia show of all time.</li>

<h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, I found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindram11/jeopardy-dataset-updated">this fantastic dataset of Jeopardy!
questions</a> on Kaggle.  I never really did much with it, but recently I
dusted and off and threw some LLMs at it.  In 2011, Watson playing Jeopardy!
was a major achievement. In 2024, it&rsquo;s a weekend project.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s 200,000+ question/answer pairs, plus the category (column) and value (row)
of the question.  (Just to be clear, this dataset follows the convention that
the &ldquo;question&rdquo; is the prompt that Alex reads, and the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; is what the
contestant should respond with&hellip; in the form a question, of course.) Here is a
sample:</p>

    html .article > table th {

<p>The Jeopardy! dataset has a number of features with make it ideal grist for
the LLM and vector embedding mill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Free text data.</li>
<li>Comes in handy prompt/response pairs.</li>
<li>Exercises knowledge, wordplay, and some inference.</li>
<li>Questions are quite short, so no chunking is necessary.</li>
<li>Mix of easy and hard questions.</li>
<li>Medium difficulty overall, making it suitable for benchmarking.</li>
</ol>

<p>There&rsquo;s also one undeniable advantage to rolling your own benchmark, no matter
how half-baked: you can be sure that implementers are gaming the metrics by
&ldquo;teaching to the test&rdquo; and including benchmark data in the pre-training or fine
tuning of their model. It&rsquo;s widely suspected that many popular benchmarks are
at least a little poisoned in this way.</p>

<p>If you plan to use the Jeopardy! dataset yourself, there are two &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that
you should be aware of:</p>

<ol>
<li>The &ldquo;value&rdquo; column is a currency field with a leading <code>$</code> and
thousand-separators, although this is currently inconsistent.</li>
<li>Some questions use audio or visual cues that are represented in the dataset
as links to external resources. These questions are unfair to the LLMs
because the clue as given doesn&rsquo;t contain enough information to narrow it
down to a unique answer. However, even if you remove those, over 200,000
&ldquo;fair&rdquo; questions remain.</li>
</ol>

<p>The functions <code>clean_currency()</code> and <code>jpt.load_jeopardy_dataset()</code> shows how to
handle these minor data quality issues.</p>

<h2 id="inference">Inference</h2>

<p>No API is 100% reliable. OpenAI has been pretty unreliable over the past year,
but in all fairness was pretty solid for this project. The AWS Bedrock API is
less mature and experienced many random failures during this project.</p>

<pre><code># reusable decorator to implement basic retry logic. We make up to three
# attempts with exponential backoff. 
retry_decorator = tenacity.retry(
    wait=tenacity.wait_exponential(min=0.1, max=2),
    stop=tenacity.stop_after_attempt(3), 
    after=tenacity.after_log(logger, logging.ERROR),
    reraise=True)
</code></pre>

<p>We use three retries because as the old saying goes, &ldquo;four is too many and two
isn&rsquo;t enough.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t why this is the case, but every programmer knows it to
be true deep in within their soul. It seems to be part of the shared
subconscious in the same way that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iQrh2TK98">37</a> is the most random number.</p>

<!--
Mini rant: a lot of Python programmers seem to think you have copy-paste
decorator config for every single function, but that's not the case. The
expression after the `@` symbol just needs to evaluate to an object which
implements the implicit decorator interface - it must be a callable that accepts
a function and returns a function. That's it. That means we can configure a
decorator once, save it as a global variable, then reuse it as often as we like.
DRY! End rant.
-->

<h2 id="prompt-engineering">Prompt Engineering</h2>

<p>Speaking of DRY, we&rsquo;ll centralize a few other things that will be constant
across all contestants, namely the prompt template and system messages:</p>

<pre><code>jeopardy_question_template = '''
CATEGORY: {category}
{clue}
'''

system_messages = [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;You are a contestant on Jeopardy. Each prompt has both the &quot;
                    &quot;category (column header) and Jeopardy clue; answer in the form &quot;
                    &quot;of a question.&quot;),
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;CATEGORY: THE BIG APPLE\nThere's an annual footrace up its &quot;
                    &quot;86 flights of stairs&quot;),
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the Empire State Building?&quot;
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>I say <code>&quot;system_messages&quot;</code>, but it also includes one example of a correct
question/answer pair. Every LLM will use the exact same prompts so that we have
a level playing field for our benchmark.</p>

<h2 id="inference-1">Inference</h2>

<p>To keep things simple, we will model our agents as simple Python functions.
For contestants, the function signature should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>PlayerAgent = Callable[[str, str], str]
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a dummy implementation of a <code>PlayerAgent</code>:</p>

<pre><code># example:
def contestant(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    answer = 42
    return f&quot;What is {answer}?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s build a real contestant. Our champion we&rsquo;ll name after Ken Jennings,
perhaps the greatest Jeopardy! player of all time. Ken will use GPT-4, which
is similarly the best-of-the-best when it comes to LLM agents.</p>

<p>To smooth over the occasional API hiccup, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>retry_decorator</code> from
above, which doesn&rsquo;t change the function signature. Then its simply a matter of
formatting the parameters into a prompt (using the above template,) sticking on
the shared system messages (so it understands the task,) and hitting the API.</p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def ken(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    '''PlayerAgent for GPT-4. Calls OpenAI.'''

    prompt = jeopardy_question_template.format(**locals())
    chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4-turbo&quot;,
        messages=system_messages + [
            {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}
        ]
    )
    content = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
    return content
</code></pre>

<p>Most contestants will look very similar to this, just with minor variations
like using a different model name, swapping <code>client.chat</code> for <code>ollama.chat</code>,
doing a little formatting for Llama3, etc. The one contestant that&rsquo;s slightly
more complicated is our RAG agent:</p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def mattea(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    '''PlayerAgent implementing the RAG pattern. It only knows the
    exact answers to questions from before 2011-01-01. It uses llama3:8b,
    a fast but fairly dumb model, so we can see the bump from RAG clearly.
    '''
    # find similar past questions 
    rag_query = f'CATEGORY: {category}\n{clue}'
    embeddings_old, jeopardy_old = old_jeopardy()
    augment_data = brute_force_search(
        embeddings_old, jeopardy_old, query=rag_query, k=10)
    augment_json = json.dumps(augment_data)

    # augment the prompt with retrieved questions
    prompt = jeopardy_question_template.format(**locals())

    # this looks cheesy, but other attempts to embed the RAG context
    # resulted in Llama3 being confused about which question's were historical
    # and which was actually being asked. This prompt fixed that.
    messages = system_messages + [
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;Correct! By the way, here are three historical &quot;
                                     &quot;questions that may help you answer future &quot;
                                     &quot;questions: {augment_json}&quot;)},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;Thank you, I'll be sure to refer back to &quot;
                                          &quot;those if they help with a question in the &quot;
                                          &quot;future!&quot;)},
        {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}
    ]

    # use a small, fast model for generation
    response = ollama.chat(
        model='llama3:8b',
        messages=messages
    )
    content = response['message']['content']
    return content
</code></pre>

<p>In Jeopardy!, the category (column header on the board) is often essential. It
can provide an initial letter, a word length, a time period, or other essential
context without which the answer might be ambiguous. For that reason, we use it
as part of the prompt template.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/category_matters.png"></p>

<p>In the first prompt, the category &ldquo;THREES&rdquo; is a clue pointing to the
&ldquo;Thrice-Great&rdquo; alchemist, while &ldquo;FRENCH&rdquo; is the crucial clue that tells us
Flamel is probably who is meant. Ken (who you&rsquo;ll recall from above is a wrapper
around <code>gpt-4-turbo</code>) is smart enough to use that context.</p>

<p>Arguably the dollar value should be included as well, since in theory knowing
if the question is supposed to be easy or obscure could help with guessing, but
this is tenuous and I haven&rsquo;t done so here.</p>

<p>TODO: Justify prompt engineering for RAG content.</p>

<p>TODO: OpenAI and local ollama.</p>

<p>Sadly, my graphics card &ldquo;only&rdquo; has 12 GB of VRAM, so it can&rsquo;t run the 70b
model. (Works great for games though!  You should see it run Cyberpunk 2077.)
Instead, we&rsquo;ll use AWS Bedrock for inference, since they just recently added
the Llama3 models. This in itself introduces a slight wrinkle - the boto3
Bedrock API is model agnostic and accepts a single &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; string instead of a
list of messages. You have to format the chat history yourself, and this format
is different for different models (and even different between llama2 and
llama3.) Luckily the format is <a href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3/">simple and well-documented</a> and we can
implement it like so:</p>

<pre><code>def format_llama3_prompt(messages: List[dict]) -&gt; str:
    '''AWS Bedrock accepts only a single string in raw format; we need to format
    messages using their special tags. Llama3 uses a different format from llama2.
    '''
    prompt = '&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;'
    for message in messages:
        role = message['role']
        content = message['content']
        assert role in ['system', 'user', 'assistant']
        prompt += f'&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;{role}&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;{content}&lt;|eot_id|&gt;'
    prompt += '&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;'
    return prompt
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, we&rsquo;ll be using three different libraries for LLM inference for this
benchmark, plus another for a local vector database:</p>

<table>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>That definitely makes getting the environment set up a bit tricky, but this
is necessary complexity for a benchmark that compares across model providers.</p>

<p>Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm">liteLLM</a> offer a compatibility layers that provide a single
API to call; that&rsquo;s definitely something to consider if you need to use several
different LLMs in one project.</p>

<h2 id="judging">Judging</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<p>Instead we use a pattern called LLM-as-Judge, where we ask another LLM agent to
grade the response. This is a good fit for the Jeopardy! dataset because the
task of deciding if an answer is correct <em>when you can see the correct answer</em>
is a much simpler task actually answering it. However, there are many cases
where the exact wording won&rsquo;t match, and an LLM can handle such cases pretty
well while saving us the trouble of manually marking 14,000 rows of results.</p>

<p>Just as with players, we&rsquo;ll also model our judge agent as a simple Python
function:</p>

<pre><code>HostAgent = Callable[[str, str, str, str], str]

    )
    content = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
    return content
</code></pre>

<p>The prompt engineering cargo cult says telling an LLM they are a famous named
person is often effective at eliciting high-quality responses. This seems to be
the case here; the <code>alex()</code> agent often adds a little explanation or extra
trivia tidbit, just like the real Alex Trebek:</p>

<pre><code>Category: THE VEEP RIGHT BEFORE...
Question: 'George H.W. Bush'
Correct Answer: Walter Mondale
Contestant's Answer: Who is Ronald Reagan?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response was, &quot;Who is Walter
                  Mondale?&quot; Ronald Reagan was the President before George
                  H.W. Bush, not the Vice President.


Category: SECOND-LARGEST CITIES
Question: 'Mosul, 1.8 million'
Correct Answer: Iraq
Contestant's Answer: What is Baghdad?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response is &quot;What is Iraq?&quot; Mosul
                  is the second-largest city in Iraq, not Baghdad.
</code></pre>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t explicitly ask it to do that in the prompt, so I&rsquo;m not sure if its
role playing as Alex Trebek, or if it&rsquo;s just a reflection of the fact that
ChatGPT often &ldquo;over-explains&rdquo; its answers even when you don&rsquo;t want it to.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of where the dataset is problematic:</p>

<pre><code>Category: &quot;WIN&quot;
Question: 'Seen here, Marie Barrow is holding this possession of her late
           brother Clyde'
Correct Answer: Winchester rifle
Contestant's Answer: What is a gun?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response is &quot;What is a Winchester
                  rifle?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the wording implies that a picture was shown, but without a link the
question slips past our &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; filter. Some quick Googling turned up what
I presume to be the photo mentioned:</p>

<p><img 
    src="/post/jeopardy_files/marie_clyde_winchester.png" 
    title="Marie Barrow holding Cylde Barrow's Winchester"
    alt="Marie Barrow holding Cylde Barrow's Winchester"></p>

<p>But of course the LLM didn&rsquo;t get to see that. The given answer is actually
pretty intelligent, considering that you&rsquo;d have to deduce that Clyde is Clyde
Barrow of Bonnie and Clyde fame, and then deduce the associated object is most
likely a gun. However, it gets marked wrong anyway.</p>

<p>Even worse, there&rsquo;s another row where a different contestant was asked the
same question and gave the same response, but this time it was judged correct!</p>

<pre><code>Category: &quot;WIN&quot;
Question: 'Seen here, Marie Barrow is holding this possession of her late 
           brother Clyde'
Correct Answer: Winchester rifle
Contestant's Answer: What is a gun?
Alex's Judgement: Correct! The response &quot;What is a gun?&quot; broadly covers 
                  the specific answer of &quot;Winchester rifle,&quot; which is 
                  indeed a type of gun.
</code></pre>

<p>So there is <em>also</em> some noise on Alex judging answers.</p>

<p>The above examples probably give the impression the whole thing is flawed, but
I had to read through a <em>lot</em> of judgements to cherry pick those errors.  I
didn&rsquo;t formally measure it but I estimate the error to be around 1%, capping
the maximum possible score to be around 99%.  This means that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate">Bayes error
rate</a> for the Jeopardy! dataset is just under 100%.  That doesn&rsquo;t make it
useless for benchmarking - many popular benchmarks have a ton of errors, and as
long as they&rsquo;re not too common it doesn&rsquo;t make much practical difference since
all LLMs will be penalized in the same way.</p>

<h2 id="agentic-workflows">Agentic Workflows</h2>

<p>Now that we have a couple of agents, we can wire them together into what are
called &ldquo;agentic workflows.&rdquo; Since we modeled our agents as Python functions,
this is straight-forward:
<!--(Or as "easy as py," if you will. Man, I crack myself up.)--></p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_dialogue(
    question_data: dict,
    contestant: PlayerAgent,
    host: HostAgent = alex) -&gt; Tuple[str, str]:
    '''Handles one question/answer/judgement interaction between the host
    and a contestant. The question is converted to a category and clue
    and passed to the contestant, who answers. Then the original question,
    the correct answer, and the contestant's given answer are passed to
    the host for judgement. 
    '''
    q = question_data
    question = q['question'].strip(&quot;'&quot;)
    contestant_answer = contestant(q['category'], question)
    judgement = alex(q['category'], question, q['answer'], contestant_answer)

    return contestant_answer, judgement
</code></pre>

<p>For the benchmark, all we need is a single, isolated question/answer/judgement
instance, but it&rsquo;s probably not hard to imagine expanding this to a workflow
that implements a proper game, with three contestants, score tracking, and
so on. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine because you already know how to create loops,
control flow, and error handling in Python.</p>

<p>There are of course <a href="https://www.langchain.com/">libraries</a> available that will help you make this
<em>way</em> more complicated and opaque, but at the same time also more rigid, if
that&rsquo;s your kind of thing.  This is apparently a good way for beginners to get
started because as we all know, there&rsquo;s nothing more educational than calling a
high-level interface that hides many of the underlying implementation details
and replaces them with its own ersatz concepts.</p>

<p>Ahem. Getting back on track, we can then our benchmarking framework on top of
that. First, ask a contestant a sample of questions and record the results:</p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_benchmark(contestant, dataset, sample_size=3) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:
    '''collects benchmark data for one contestant by choosing `n` random questions
    from the dataset, putting the question to the contestant agent, and using the `alex()`
    agent to determine correctness.
    '''
    jeopardy_sample = random.sample(dataset, sample_size)

    for question_data in jeopardy_sample:
        contestant_answer, judgement = jeopardy_dialogue(
            question_data=question_data, 
            contestant=contestant)

        question_data['contestant_answer'] = contestant_answer
        question_data['judgement'] = judgement

        # parse the host's free-text response to get a Boolean flag.
        question_data['correct'] = judgement.lower().startswith('correct')


    jeopardy_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(jeopardy_sample)

    return jeopardy_df
</code></pre>

<p>Then do that for a list of contestants:</p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_benchmark_suite(
    jeopardy_data: List,
    contestants: List = None,
    sample_size: int = 3,
    seed: int = None) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:
    '''Runs the Jeopardy! benchmark for a number of contestants. All
    contestants receive the exact same set of questions. Results
    are returned in a single dataframe with contestants distinguished 
    by the &quot;label&quot; column.
    '''    
    all_benchmark_results = []
    if contestants is None:
        contestants = [amy, ken, larissa, david, brad, james, mattea]

    if seed is None:
        seed = sample_size

    with TemporarySeed(seed):
        for contestant in contestants:
            benchmark_results_df = jeopardy_benchmark(
                contestant,
                dataset=jeopardy_data,
                sample_size=sample_size)

            benchmark_results_df.insert(0, 'label', contestant.__name__)
            all_benchmark_results.append(benchmark_results_df)

    all_benchmark_results_df = pd.concat(all_benchmark_results)
    return all_benchmark_results_df
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, collate the raw results down to a summary for each contestant:</p>

<pre><code>def evaluate_jeopardy_benchmark(benchmark_results: pd.DataFrame, label=None) -&gt; dict:
    '''Evaluates the performance of a single contestant, i.e. computes
    success rate and standard error.
    '''
    successes = benchmark_results['correct'].sum()
    failures = (~benchmark_results['correct']).sum()
    sample_size = successes + failures

    # Compute proportion and standard error
    success_rate = successes / sample_size
    safe_success_rate = (successes + 0.5) / (sample_size + 1)
    se = math.sqrt(safe_success_rate * (1 - safe_success_rate) / sample_size)

    # human readable error bars
    margin_of_error = 1.96 * se

    return { 
        &quot;label&quot;: label,
        &quot;successes&quot;: successes,
        &quot;failures&quot;: failures,
        &quot;sample_size&quot;: sample_size,
        &quot;success_rate&quot;: success_rate,
        &quot;standard_error&quot;: se,
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously the data that was plotted on the bar chart at the top.  You
can see the plotting code in <code>jpt.py</code> if you want; I&rsquo;ll omit it here as it uses
<code>matplotlib</code> and is therefore quite unbelievably ugly. (I use <code>matplotlib</code>
quite a bit and love its functionality, but <em>man</em> is it hard to get it to do what
you want the instant you step off the happy path. My number one use of ChatGPT is
generating boilerplate code <code>matplotlib</code> visualizations.)</p>

<h2 id="fine-tuning">Fine Tuning</h2>

<p>OpenAI expects <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset">fine tuning training data</a> to be provided in the JSONL
format with one example per line. Each line should be a JSON object containing
the messages for one chat session in the same message format used by the
<code>chat.completions</code> API.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s trivial to implement this format. Note that we include the same system
prompt that we will use for the task, and that we provide the Jeopardy!
question in the exact same format we will use for the real task. Finally, note
that we take the opportunity to teach it that every response should be in the
form of a question. (Many contestants such as <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/contestants/matt-amodio-talks-winning-streak-ken-jennings-and-most-stressful-jeopardy-moment">Matt Amodio</a> invariably use
the &ldquo;What is X?&rdquo; form instead wasting time thinking about the appropriate
interrogative  and risk making a mistake, so we know this is a valid strategy.)</p>

<pre><code>def format_for_fine_tuning(
    category: str, 
    question: str, 
    answer: str, 
    **kwargs) -&gt; dict:
    '''formats one question/answer pair as one line in an OpenAI 
    fine-tuning .jsonl file.
    '''
    messages = [
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;You are a contestant on Jeopardy. Answer in the form of a &quot;
                        &quot;question.&quot;)
        },
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: f'\nCATEGORY: {category}\n{question}'
        },
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;What is {answer}?&quot;
        }
    ]
    return { &quot;messages&quot;: messages }
</code></pre>

<p>The function <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/jpt.py#L520"><code>jpt.generate_fine_tuning_data()</code></a> runs this for a random sample
of data and writes it to a file.  I&rsquo;ve also included a sample of the resulting <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/data/jeopardy_fine_tuning_sample_1000.jsonl">JSONL file</a>.</p>

<p>Fine tuning on 1,000 examples took about 30 minutes and cost about a dollar.
Note also that inference is also much more expensive for a fine-tuned model
than for baseline GPT-3.5 - most of the expense won&rsquo;t be the initial training
but usage.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/spend.png"></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the benefit of fine-tuning is achieved in the
first ten minutes, and this is consistent with the fact that fine-tuning on 10k
didn&rsquo;t improve performance over training on 1k. I&rsquo;ll talk more about why I
think that is in the conclusion below.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/training_loss_graph_10k.png"></p>

<p>Calling the fine-tuned model is simply a matter of passing a new model ID to
the API. We&rsquo;ll this wrap this in another standard <code>PlayerAgent</code> function. This
one is named after Amy Schneider, who had a 40 game winning streak and would
often go several games in a row without a single mistake:</p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def amy(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    '''PlayerAgent for a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo. Calls OpenAI.'''

    prompt = jeopardy_question_template.format(**locals())
    chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=&quot;ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal:jeopardy1k:9MJuormU&quot;,
        messages=system_messages + [
            {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}
        ]
    )
    content = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
    return content

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/jeopardy_dataset_metrics.png"></p>

<p>TODO: indexing vector databases</p>

<p>TODO: brute force vs. HNSW</p>

<p>Here is how you implement exact search using cosine similarity:</p>

<pre><code>distances = 1.0 - (database @ query)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>@</code> is the Python operator for matrix multiply. Alright, fine,
there&rsquo;s a little more ceremony to it:</p>

<pre><code>def best_k(database: np.ndarray, query: np.ndarray, k: int = 5):
    '''Brute force best-k algorithm. Simply computes *all*
    the cosine distances between the query and every embedding
    vector in the database and returns the top-k in sorted order
    (lowest distance first.) Call `brute_force_search()` for
    a higher level interface.
    '''
    # Normalize the query vector
    query = query / np.linalg.norm(query)

    # Compute cosine distances
    distances = 1.0 - (database @ query)

    # Find the indices of the k smallest distances
    best_k_unsorted = np.argpartition(distances, k)[:k]

    # Sort these indices by distance
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(distances[best_k_unsorted])
    best_k_sorted = best_k_unsorted[sorted_indices]
    best_k_distances = distances[best_k_sorted]

    return best_k_distances, best_k_sorted
</code></pre>

<p>But it&rsquo;s that one matrix multiply that&rsquo;s doing all the work; the rest
runs in a fraction of the time. Even that&rsquo;s a little more complex
than it needs to be - we save a few milliseconds by using <code>np.argpartiion()</code>
and then only sorting the top <code>k</code> results when it would have been more
obvious to simply sort them all and take the first <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>The brute force strategy is surprisingly viable for small vector stores of only
a few thousand or tens of thousands of chunks, but by the time we&rsquo;ve reached
the 200,000+ chunks of the Jeopardy! dataset it&rsquo;s definitely started to wear
out its welcome. By that point, the HNSW algorithm (which scales as $O(\log n)$
for search) is over a 100 times faster than brute force.</p>

<p>TODO: stat-sig.</p>

<h4 id="fine-tuning-1">Fine-Tuning</h4>

<p>Fining tuning works, but it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo; kind of deal.
OpenAI&rsquo;s rates for fine-tuned models are priced midway between GPT-4 and
GPT-3.5, but so is performance. Then there&rsquo;s the headache of curating and
maintaining a fine-tuning dataset&hellip; unless you actually beat a GPT-4 model with
your fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model (which is going to be very use case dependent) its
a lot of complexity for a very marginal cost savings.  It didn&rsquo;t work for the
Jeopardy! dataset, but maybe it&rsquo;ll work for yours.</p>

<p>Of course, when OpenAI finally starts offering fine-tuning of GPT-4 models,
fine-tuning may allow us to unlock a whole new level of performance, but that&rsquo;s
future state. Right now it&rsquo;s very situational.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me about the fine-tuning is that the performance gain
all came from the first few hundred records. The training loss curves flattened
out pretty quickly and there wasn&rsquo;t any benefit from fine tuning on a larger 10k
dataset. That means we&rsquo;re not teaching the model the answers to specific trivia
questions, <em>we&rsquo;re teaching it how to be a Jeopardy! contestant.</em> That&rsquo;s also why
the performance bump generalizes to novel data - it&rsquo;s not about memorization.
That tells us that fine-tuning is the tool we should reach for to <em>steer</em> our
models:  to improve compliance or to stay on task.</p>

<h4 id="rag">RAG</h4>

<p>RAG gives us a whopping <em>24 percentage points</em> over the baseline model, and gets
us within spitting distance of the Llama3 70 billion parameter model while still
allowing us to run a fast, cheap, (possibly even local) LLM. The overhead of RAG
itself is fairly minimal. There is an added 0.2 - 0.3 second latency for hitting
OpenAI embeddings API, which eats into the performance gains of running a
smaller model. (Latency is the only real downside: cost is very low and
throughput won&rsquo;t be affected.) Vector databases are pretty inexpensive to index
and query so unless you&rsquo;re operating at Wikipedia scale the costs will be pretty
nominal.</p>

<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to use RAG with a small model; you could pair it with
GPT-4 or other SOTA if you&rsquo;re focused on quality over throughput, latency, or
cost.  Unlike fine-tuning, RAG doesn&rsquo;t lock you into a particular LLM choice. I
see why there&rsquo;s a lot of hype around it; it&rsquo;s cheap, it&rsquo;s fast, it scales well,
it&rsquo;s easy to implement (you don&rsquo;t have to hand-curate training examples but
just chunk whatever useful documents are lying around) and it works.</p>

<h4 id="llama3">Llama3</h4>

<p>Llama3 is fine. TODO</p>
