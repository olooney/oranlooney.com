<p>How good are LLMs at trivia? I used the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindram11/jeopardy-dataset-updated">Jeopardy! dataset</a> from Kaggle to
benchmark ChatGPT and the new Llama 3 models.  Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/benchmark7.png"></p>

<p>There you go. You&rsquo;ve already gotten 90% of what you&rsquo;re going to get out of this
article.  Some guy on the internet ran a half-baked benchmark on a handful of
LLM models, and the results were largely in line with <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/">popular benchmarks</a>
and received wisdom on fine-tuning and RAG.</p>

<p>Still, the process was interesting, so I&rsquo;m going to talk about it. At length.
You&rsquo;ve been warned.</p>

<p>All <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt">code</a> for this article is available on GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
<li>Have my own point-of-view on Llama 3 vs. ChatGPT.</li>
<li>Demonstrate fine-tuning has a measurable benefit.</li>
<li>Demonstrate RAG has a measurable benefit.</li>
<li>Have fun and pay homage to Jeopardy!, the greatest trivia show of all time.</li>
</ol>

<p>There&rsquo;s one undeniable advantage to rolling your own benchmark, no matter how
half-baked: you can be sure that implementers are gaming the metrics by
&ldquo;teaching to the test&rdquo; and including benchmark data in the pre-training or fine
tuning of their model. It&rsquo;s widely suspected that many popular benchmarks are
at least a little poisoned in this way.</p>

<p>For fine-tuning, OpenAI provides by far the easiest path. Since they only offer
fine-tuning on 3.5, we&rsquo;ll benchmark gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5, and a fine-tuned
version of gpt-3.5. That will let us see where fine-tuning lands between 3.5
and 4 and gives us a spread to compare against Llama 3.</p>

<p>For Llama 3, we&rsquo;ll want to test both the big and small versions of the model.
I&rsquo;m mainly interested to see how Llama 3 stacks up against ChatGPT, but I&rsquo;ve
also included one Llama 2 model to see if Llama 3 is an improvement.</p>

<p>For RAG, we&rsquo;ll build a small local database and then use it to augment one
of the smaller Llama 3 models. Not only will  that keep inference costs low
but the benefit of RAG should be easier to see if we start from a lower
baseline. We&rsquo;ll have to be careful with CV (described below.)</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by taking a look at the dataset.</p>

<h2 id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, I found this fantastic <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindram11/jeopardy-dataset-updated">dataset of Jeopardy!
questions</a> on Kaggle.  I never really did anything with it, but recently I
dusted it off and took another look. This time, I could see a pretty clear use for
it. In 2011, IBM Watson playing Jeopardy! was a major achievement. In 2024, it&rsquo;s a
weekend project.</p>

<p>The dataset consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs, plus the category
(column) and value (row) of the question. Here is a sample to give you an idea
of what it contains:</p>

<style>

<p>Just to be clear, this dataset follows the convention that the &ldquo;question&rdquo; is
the prompt that Alex reads, and the &ldquo;answer&rdquo; is what the contestant should
respond with&hellip; in the form a question, of course. That is the convention I&rsquo;ll
stick to for this project.</p>

<p>It has a number of features that make it ideal grist for the LLM mill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mainly free text, necessitating some kind of NLP or LLM approach.</li>
<li>Comes in handy prompt/response pairs.</li>
<li>Exercises knowledge, wordplay, and some inference.</li>
<li>Questions are quite short, so no chunking is necessary.</li>
<li>Good mix of easy and hard questions.</li>
<li>Medium difficulty overall, making it suitable for benchmarking.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you plan on using the Jeopardy! dataset yourself there are two &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that
you should be aware of:</p>

<p>First, the &ldquo;value&rdquo; column is a currency field with a leading <code>$</code> and
thousand separators, although this is currently inconsistent.  The functions
<a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/jpt.py#L440"><code>clean_currency()</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/jpt.py#L457"><code>load_jeopardy_dataset()</code></a> show how to
handle this minor data quality issue.</p>

<p>Second, some questions use audio or visual cues that are represented in the
dataset as links to external resources. These questions are unfair to the LLMs
because the clue as given doesn&rsquo;t contain enough information to narrow it down
to a unique answer. <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/jpt.py#L457"><code>load_jeopardy_dataset()</code></a> has an optional flag for
removing questions containing an external link.  Don&rsquo;t worry; even after
removing all the &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; questions, over 200,000 &ldquo;fair&rdquo; questions remain.</p>

<h2 id="prompt-engineering">Prompt Engineering</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll centralize a few other things that will be the same across all
contestants, namely the prompt template and system messages:</p>

<pre><code>jeopardy_question_template = '''
CATEGORY: {category}
{clue}
'''

system_messages = [
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;You are a contestant on Jeopardy. Each prompt has both the &quot;
                    &quot;category (column header) and Jeopardy clue; answer in the form &quot;
                    &quot;of a question.&quot;),
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;CATEGORY: THE BIG APPLE\nThere's an annual footrace up its &quot;
                    &quot;86 flights of stairs&quot;),
    },
    {
        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;,
        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the Empire State Building?&quot;
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>I say <code>system_messages</code>, but it also includes one example of a correct
question/answer pair. Every conversation will start with the exact same prompts
so that we have a level playing field for all contestants.</p>

<h2 id="inference">Inference</h2>

<h3 id="retry-logic">Retry Logic</h3>

<p>No API is 100% reliable. OpenAI has been pretty unreliable over the past year
but, in all fairness, it was pretty solid for this project. The AWS Bedrock API
is less mature and experienced many random failures during this project.</p>

<pre><code># reusable decorator to implement basic retry logic. We make up to three
# attempts with exponential backoff. 
retry_decorator = tenacity.retry(
    wait=tenacity.wait_exponential(min=0.1, max=2),
    stop=tenacity.stop_after_attempt(3), 
    after=tenacity.after_log(logger, logging.ERROR),
    reraise=True)
</code></pre>

<p>We use three retries because as the old saying goes, &ldquo;four is too many and two
isn&rsquo;t enough.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t why this is the case, but every programmer knows it to
be true deep in within their soul. It seems to be part of the shared
subconscious, similar to how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6iQrh2TK98">37</a> is the most random number.</p>

<!--
Mini rant: a lot of Python programmers seem to think you have copy-paste
decorator config for every single function, but that's not the case. The
expression after the `@` symbol just needs to evaluate to an object which
implements the implicit decorator interface - it must be a callable that accepts
a function and returns a function. That's it. That means we can configure a
decorator once, save it as a global variable, then reuse it as often as we like.
DRY! End rant.
-->

<h3 id="player-agents">Player Agents</h3>

<p>To keep things simple, we&rsquo;ll model our agents as simple Python functions.
The function signature for contestants should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>PlayerAgent = Callable[[str, str], str]
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a dummy implementation of a <code>PlayerAgent</code>:</p>

<pre><code># example:
def contestant(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    answer = 42
    return f&quot;What is {answer}?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>To keep things light, we&rsquo;ll name all our agents after famous Jeopardy! stars.
We&rsquo;ll start with Ken Jennings, perhaps the greatest Jeopardy! player of all
time.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/ken.jpg"></p>

<p>Ken will use GPT-4 Turbo, which is similarly best-of-breed when it comes to LLM
agents.</p>

<p>To smooth over the occasional API hiccup, we&rsquo;ll use the <code>retry_decorator</code> from
above, which doesn&rsquo;t change the function signature. Then its simply a matter of
formatting the parameters into a prompt (using the above template,) sticking on
the shared system messages (so it understands the task,) and hitting the API.</p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def ken(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    '''PlayerAgent for GPT-4. Calls OpenAI.'''

    prompt = jeopardy_question_template.format(**locals())
    chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=&quot;gpt-4-turbo&quot;,
        messages=system_messages + [
            {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}
        ]
    )
    content = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
    return content
</code></pre>

<p>Most contestants will look very similar to this, just with minor variations
like using a different model name, swapping <code>client.chat</code> for <code>ollama.chat</code>,
doing a little formatting for Llama 3, etc.</p>

<p>In Jeopardy!, the category (column header on the board) is often crucial. It
can provide an initial letter, a word length, a time period, or other essential
context without which the answer might be ambiguous. For that reason, we use it
as part of the prompt template.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/category_matters.png"></p>

<p>In the first prompt, the category &ldquo;THREES&rdquo; is a clue pointing to the
&ldquo;Thrice-Great&rdquo; alchemist, while &ldquo;FRENCH&rdquo; is the crucial clue that tells us
Flamel is probably who is meant. Ken (who you&rsquo;ll recall from above is a wrapper
around <code>gpt-4-turbo</code>) is smart enough to use that context.</p>

<p>Arguably the dollar value should be included as well, since in theory knowing
if the question is supposed to be easy or obscure could help with guessing, but
this is tenuous and I haven&rsquo;t done so here.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>Models have to run somewhere - even the cloud is just someone else&rsquo;s hardware.
For OpenAI, our choices are Azure or OpenAI&rsquo;s own servers, since the model
weights are proprietary and cannot be run locally. We&rsquo;ll use OpenAI&rsquo;s server
for this project.</p>

<p>Llama is more open. You can download and run the models locally if you have a
powerful enough computer. There are several ways to do this, but
<a href="https://ollama.com/"><code>ollama</code></a> bills itself as a quick and easy way to run model locally, and
I found this to be pretty accurate. You install it, pull the model weights you
want using the CLI, and then use the Python <code>ollama</code> package to talk to your
local <code>ollama</code> server. It&rsquo;s all pretty painless and worked well for <code>llama2:7b</code>
and <code>llama3:8b</code>.</p>

<p>Sadly, my graphics card &ldquo;only&rdquo; has 12 GB of VRAM, so I wasn&rsquo;t able to run the
<code>llama3:70b</code> locally. (Works great for games though!  You should see it run
Cyberpunk 2077.)</p>

<p>Instead, I used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/">AWS Bedrock</a> for inference, as they just recently added
the Llama 3 models. This introduces a slight wrinkle - the <code>boto3</code> Bedrock API
is model agnostic and accepts a single &ldquo;prompt&rdquo; string rather than a list of
messages. You have to format the chat history yourself, and this format is
different for different models (and even different between Llama 2 and 3!)</p>

<p>Luckily, the format is simple and <a href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3/">well-documented</a> and we can implement it
like so:</p>

<pre><code>def format_llama3_prompt(messages: List[dict]) -&gt; str:
    '''AWS Bedrock accepts only a single string in raw format; we need to format
    messages using their special tags. Llama 3 uses a different format from llama2.
    '''
    prompt = '&lt;|begin_of_text|&gt;'
    for message in messages:
        role = message['role']
        content = message['content']
        assert role in ['system', 'user', 'assistant']
        prompt += f'&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;{role}&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;{content}&lt;|eot_id|&gt;'
    prompt += '&lt;|start_header_id|&gt;assistant&lt;|end_header_id|&gt;'
    return prompt
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, we&rsquo;ll be using three different libraries for LLM inference for this
benchmark, plus a fourth for the local vector database:</p>

</table>

<p>That definitely makes getting the environment set up a bit tricky, but this
is necessary complexity for a benchmark that compares across model providers
and libraries.</p>

<p>Libraries like <a href="https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm">liteLLM</a> offer a compatibility layer that provide a single
API to call; that&rsquo;s definitely something to consider if you need to use several
different LLMs in one project.</p>

<h2 id="judging-correctness">Judging Correctness</h2>

<p>For the benchmark to work, we need to know if the contestant is correct or not.
Since the correct answer is given in the dataset, the fastest and easiest way
to do that is with a simple string compare. The problem is that there are
several correct ways to phrase an answer. In fact, sometimes the correct answer
listed in the dataset actually lists more than one correct response.</p>

<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, we could have a human manually check each
answer. But lets think about what that would involve for a second. We need a
sample size of about 2,000 to get sufficient statistical power to distinguish
between similar contestants, and we have 7 different contestants to benchmark.
That&rsquo;s 14,000 answers to judge; and frankly there are more pleasant ways to
spend a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<!-- ain't no one got time for that dot jpg -->

<p>Instead, we use a pattern called &ldquo;LLM-as-Judge&rdquo;, where we ask another LLM agent
to grade the response. This is a good fit for the Jeopardy! dataset because the
task of deciding if an answer is correct <em>when you can see the correct answer</em>
is much easier than actually answering it. Plus, there are many cases where the
exact wording won&rsquo;t match and an LLM can handle such cases while saving us the
trouble of manually marking 14,000 rows of results.</p>

<h3 id="host-agent">Host Agent</h3>

<p>Just as with players, we&rsquo;ll also model our judge agent as a simple Python
function:</p>

<pre><code>HostAgent = Callable[[str, str, str, str], str]
</code></pre>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a stub implementation of <code>HostAgent</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def host(
    category: str, 
    clue: str, 
    correct_response: str, 
    contestant_response: str
) -&gt; str:
    factually_correct = (correct_response in contestant_response)
    phrased_correctly = (contestant_response[-1] == '?')
    correct = (factually_correct and phrased_correctly)

    return 'Correct! if correct else 'Incorrect.'
</code></pre>

<p>We need to implement the same interface delegating the judgment to an LLM.
We will of course name our agent after Alex Trebek.</p>

<h3 id="bayes-rate">Bayes Rate</h3>

<p>Asking an LLM to emulate a famous person is often effective at eliciting
high-quality responses. This seems to be the case here; with this agent
achieving high accuracy.  In fact, the <code>alex()</code> agent often adds a little
explanation or extra trivia tidbit, just like the real Alex Trebek:</p>

<pre><code>Category: THE VEEP RIGHT BEFORE...
Question: 'George H.W. Bush'
Correct Answer: Walter Mondale
Contestant's Answer: Who is Ronald Reagan?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response was, &quot;Who is Walter
                  Mondale?&quot; Ronald Reagan was the President before George
                  H.W. Bush, not the Vice President.


Category: SECOND-LARGEST CITIES
Question: 'Mosul, 1.8 million'
Correct Answer: Iraq
Contestant's Answer: What is Baghdad?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response is &quot;What is Iraq?&quot; Mosul
                  is the second-largest city in Iraq, not Baghdad.
</code></pre>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t explicitly ask it to do that, so I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s role playing or
if this is just a reflection of the fact that ChatGPT often &ldquo;over-explains&rdquo; its
answers even when you don&rsquo;t want it to.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a row in the dataset that&rsquo;s problematic:</p>

<pre><code>Category: &quot;WIN&quot;
Question: 'Seen here, Marie Barrow is holding this possession of her late
           brother Clyde'
Correct Answer: Winchester rifle
Contestant's Answer: What is a gun?
Alex's Judgement: Incorrect. The correct response is &quot;What is a Winchester
                  rifle?&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the wording implies that a picture was shown, but without a link, the
question slips past our &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; filter. Some quick Googling turned up what
I presume to be the photo mentioned:</p>

<p><img 
    src="/post/jeopardy_files/marie_clyde_winchester.png" 
    title="Marie Barrow Holding Cylde Barrow's Winchester"
    alt="Marie Barrow Holding Cylde Barrow's Winchester"></p>

<p>But of course the LLM didn&rsquo;t get to see that. The given answer is actually
pretty intelligent, considering that you&rsquo;d have to deduce that Clyde is Clyde
Barrow of Bonnie and Clyde fame, and then deduce the associated object is most
likely a gun. However, it was marked wrong anyway.</p>

<p>Even worse, there&rsquo;s another row where a different contestant was asked the
same question and gave the same response, but this time it was judged correct!</p>

<pre><code>Category: &quot;WIN&quot;
Question: 'Seen here, Marie Barrow is holding this possession of her late 
           brother Clyde'
Correct Answer: Winchester rifle
Contestant's Answer: What is a gun?
Alex's Judgement: Correct! The response &quot;What is a gun?&quot; broadly covers 
                  the specific answer of &quot;Winchester rifle,&quot; which is 
                  indeed a type of gun.
</code></pre>

<p>So there is <em>also</em> some inconsistency in judging answers. I did set the
temperature to zero, but I&rsquo;ve heard that isn&rsquo;t always enough to get 100%
deterministic behavior out of GPT-4.</p>

<p>The above examples probably give the impression the whole LLM-as-Judge thing is
flawed, but I had to read through a <em>lot</em> of judgements to cherry pick those
errors.  I didn&rsquo;t formally measure it but I estimate the error to be around 1%,
capping the maximum possible score to be around 99%.  This means that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_error_rate">Bayes error rate</a> for the Jeopardy! dataset is just under 100%.  That
doesn&rsquo;t make it any less useful for benchmarking - many popular benchmarks have
a ton of errors. As long as the errors are not too common it doesn&rsquo;t make much
practical difference since all LLMs will be penalized in the same way.</p>

<h2 id="agentic-workflow">Agentic Workflow</h2>

<p>Now that we have a couple of agents, we can wire them together into what are
called &ldquo;agentic workflows.&rdquo; Since we modeled our agents as Python functions,
this is straightforward:
<!--(Or as "easy as py," if you will. Man, I crack myself up.)--></p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_dialogue(
    question_data: dict,
    contestant: PlayerAgent,
    host: HostAgent = alex) -&gt; Tuple[str, str]:
    '''Handles one question/answer/judgement interaction between the host
    and a contestant. The question is converted to a category and clue
    and passed to the contestant, who answers. Then the original question,
    the correct answer, and the contestant's given answer are passed to
    the host for judgement. 
    '''
    q = question_data
    question = q['question'].strip(&quot;'&quot;)
    contestant_answer = contestant(q['category'], question)
    judgement = alex(q['category'], question, q['answer'], contestant_answer)

    return contestant_answer, judgement
</code></pre>

<p>For the benchmark, we need only a linear question/answer/judgement flow, but
it&rsquo;s probably not hard to imagine expanding this to a workflow that implements
a proper game of Jeopardy!, with three contestants, score tracking, and so on.
It&rsquo;s easy to imagine because you already know how to create loops, control
flow, and error handling in Python.</p>

<p>There are of course <a href="https://www.langchain.com/">libraries</a> available that will help you make this
<em>way</em> more complicated and opaque, but somehow simultaneously more rigid, if
that&rsquo;s your kind of thing.  This is apparently a good way for beginners to get
started because as we all know, there&rsquo;s nothing more educational than calling a
high-level interface that hides many of the underlying implementation details
and replaces them with its own ersatz concepts.</p>

<p>Ahem. Getting back on track, we can then our benchmarking framework on top of
that. First, ask a contestant a random sample of questions and record the
results:</p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_benchmark(contestant, dataset, sample_size=3) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:
    '''collects benchmark data for one contestant by choosing `n` random questions
    from the dataset, putting the question to the contestant agent, and using the 
    `alex()` agent to determine correctness.
    '''
    jeopardy_sample = random.sample(dataset, sample_size)

    for question_data in jeopardy_sample:
        contestant_answer, judgement = jeopardy_dialogue(
            question_data=question_data, 
            contestant=contestant)

        question_data['contestant_answer'] = contestant_answer
        question_data['judgement'] = judgement

        # parse the host's free-text response to get a Boolean flag.
        question_data['correct'] = judgement.lower().startswith('correct')

    jeopardy_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(jeopardy_sample)
    return jeopardy_df
</code></pre>

<p>Then do that for a list of contestants:</p>

<pre><code>def jeopardy_benchmark_suite(
    jeopardy_data: List,
    contestants: List = None,
    sample_size: int = 3,
    seed: int = None) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:
    '''Runs the Jeopardy! benchmark for a number of contestants. All
    contestants receive the exact same set of questions. Results
    are returned in a single dataframe with contestants distinguished 
    by the &quot;label&quot; column.
    '''    
    all_benchmark_results = []
    if contestants is None:
        contestants = [amy, ken, larissa, david, brad, james, mattea]

    if seed is None:
        seed = sample_size

    with TemporarySeed(seed):
        for contestant in contestants:
            benchmark_results_df = jeopardy_benchmark(
                contestant,
                dataset=jeopardy_data,
                sample_size=sample_size)

            benchmark_results_df.insert(0, 'label', contestant.__name__)
            all_benchmark_results.append(benchmark_results_df)

    all_benchmark_results_df = pd.concat(all_benchmark_results)
    return all_benchmark_results_df
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, collate the raw results down to a summary for each contestant:</p>

<pre><code>def evaluate_jeopardy_benchmark(benchmark_results: pd.DataFrame, label=None) -&gt; dict:
    '''Evaluates the performance of a single contestant, i.e. computes
    success rate and standard error.
    '''
    successes = benchmark_results['correct'].sum()
    failures = (~benchmark_results['correct']).sum()
    sample_size = successes + failures

    # Compute proportion and standard error
    success_rate = successes / sample_size
    safe_success_rate = (successes + 0.5) / (sample_size + 1)
    se = math.sqrt(safe_success_rate * (1 - safe_success_rate) / sample_size)

    # human readable error bars
    margin_of_error = 1.96 * se

    return { 
        &quot;label&quot;: label,
        &quot;successes&quot;: successes,
        &quot;failures&quot;: failures,
        &quot;sample_size&quot;: sample_size,
        &quot;success_rate&quot;: success_rate,
        &quot;standard_error&quot;: se,
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This gives us the underlying data that was plotted on the bar chart at the top.</p>

<h2 id="fine-tuning">Fine-Tuning</h2>

<p>One of the things I wanted to benchmark was the effect of fine-tuning. Does
it really measurably improve performance?</p>

<p>OpenAI expects <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/preparing-your-dataset">fine-tuning training data</a> to be provided in the JSONL
format with one example per line. Each line should be a JSON object containing
the messages for one chat session, using the same message format used by the
<code>chat.completions</code> API.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to implement the specified format:</p>

<pre><code>def format_for_fine_tuning(
    category: str, 
    question: str, 
    answer: str, 
    **kwargs) -&gt; dict:
    '''formats one question/answer pair as one line in an OpenAI 
    fine-tuning .jsonl file.
    '''
    messages = [
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: (&quot;You are a contestant on Jeopardy. Answer in the &quot;
                        &quot;form of a question.&quot;)
        },
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: f'\nCATEGORY: {category}\n{question}'
        },
        {
            &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, 
            &quot;content&quot;: f&quot;What is {answer}?&quot;
        }
    ]
    return { &quot;messages&quot;: messages }
</code></pre>

<p>We include the same system prompt that we will use for the task, and we provide
the Jeopardy! question in the exact same format we will use for the real task.
We omit the &ldquo;1-shot&rdquo; example - the fine-tuning should now fill the same role.
Finally, note that we take the opportunity to teach it that every response
should be in the form of a question. (Many contestants such as <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/jbuzz/contestants/matt-amodio-talks-winning-streak-ken-jennings-and-most-stressful-jeopardy-moment">Matt
Amodio</a> invariably use the form &ldquo;What is X?&rdquo; instead wasting time thinking
about the appropriate interrogative.)</p>

<p>The function <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/jpt.py#L520"><code>jpt.generate_fine_tuning_data()</code></a> runs this for a random
sample of data and writes it to a file.  I&rsquo;ve also included a sample of the
resulting <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/data/jeopardy_fine_tuning_sample_1000.jsonl">JSONL file</a>.</p>

<p>Fine tuning on 1,000 examples took about 30 minutes and cost about a dollar.
However, inference is also <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">more expensive</a> for a fine-tuned model than
for baseline GPT-3.5 - only slightly less expensive than GPT-4 Turbo. That
means that in a typical production setting most of the expense won&rsquo;t be the
initial fine-tuning but rather usage over time.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, most of the benefit of fine-tuning is achieved in the
first ten minutes. This is consistent with the fact that fine-tuning on 10k
didn&rsquo;t improve performance over training on 1k. I&rsquo;ll discuss this in more detail
in the conclusion below.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/training_loss_graph_10k.png"></p>

<p>Calling the fine-tuned model is simply a matter of passing a new model ID to
the API. We&rsquo;ll this wrap this in another standard <code>PlayerAgent</code> function. This
one is named after Amy Schneider, who had a 40 game winning streak and would
often go several games in a row without a single mistake.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/amy.png"></p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def amy(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:
    '''PlayerAgent for a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-Turbo. Calls OpenAI.'''

    prompt = jeopardy_question_template.format(**locals())
    chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=&quot;ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-1106:personal:jeopardy1k:9MJuormU&quot;,
        messages=system_messages + [
            {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: prompt}
        ]
    )
    content = chat_response.choices[0].message.content
    return content
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously I don&rsquo;t recommend hard-coding the fine-tuned model ID like this, but
since this project is only intended to run once there&rsquo;s no need to
future-proof.</p>

<p>As an aside, I wish OpenAI had a way to register named &ldquo;versions&rdquo; of a model,
like <a href="https://mlflow.org/">MLFlow</a> and similar tools. Having to change the config for your
client code every time you re-run the fine-tuning is kinda annoying, but not
a deal-breaker.</p>

<h2 id="vector-database">Vector Database</h2>

<p>For RAG, we&rsquo;ll want to use a vector database to store and quickly retrieve
semantically related questions. One nice thing about the Jeopardy! dataset is
that every question is much, much shorter than the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models">8,191 token limit</a> on
the <code>text-embedding-ada-002</code> model. (What happened to that 8,192<sup>nd</sup>
token, I wonder?) That means we don&rsquo;t have to think about &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; at all -
we&rsquo;ll just make a separate chunk for each question.</p>

<p>This has the effect of greatly inflating the size of the dataset. A 1,536
dimensional vector of 32-bit floats takes up 6,144 bytes each. So 200,000
vectors require a total of 1.2 GB. Storing the original question data and the
exact chunk text brings that up to 1.3 GB. That means 90% of our database size
is just the embedding vectors. That isn&rsquo;t normally the case; when making use of
the full 8,191 tokens for each chunk, the original text and vectors take up
roughly the same amount of space. Nevertheless, I think it&rsquo;s the right call use
use one chunk per question, because it wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense at all to
confuse things by stuffing multiple questions into each chunk. Sure, it would
take up less space, but the semantic vectors from multiple questions would be
muddled together, and when you&rsquo;d retrieve a chunk you&rsquo;d pull in dozen unrelated
questions.</p>

<p>It takes about 30 minutes to generate embeddings for all 200,000 questions,
and then another minute to generate a local HNSW index for them. Luckily,
we only have to do that once.</p>

<p>The 1.3 GB index takes one second to read off disk, but again, that&rsquo;s something
we only need to do at the start of each process. Once it&rsquo;s loaded, querying the
vector database is incredibly fast - less than one millisecond.  In fact,
it&rsquo;s dwarfed by the time it takes to hit OpenAI&rsquo;s embedding API to convert
query strings into vectors. (I wonder if we could achieve lower latency with a
local embedding model? But most of the really good embedding models seem to be
proprietary&hellip; how much recall and precision are we prepared to give up
for faster results?)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of these different costs and times:</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/jeopardy_dataset_metrics.png"></p>

<h3 id="brute-force">Brute Force</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to compare HNSW to the brute force approach.  Here is how you
would implement exact search using cosine similarity:</p>

<pre><code>distances = 1.0 - (database @ query)
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>@</code> is the Python operator for matrix multiply. Alright, fine,
there&rsquo;s a little more ceremony to it:</p>

<pre><code>def best_k(database: np.ndarray, query: np.ndarray, k: int = 5):
    '''Brute force best-k algorithm. Simply computes *all*
    the cosine distances between the query and every embedding
    vector in the database and returns the top-k in sorted order
    (lowest distance first.) Call `brute_force_search()` for
    a higher level interface.
    '''
    # Normalize the query vector
    query = query / np.linalg.norm(query)

    # Compute cosine distances
    distances = 1.0 - (database @ query)

    # Find the indices of the k smallest distances
    best_k_unsorted = np.argpartition(distances, k)[:k]

    # Sort these indices by distance
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(distances[best_k_unsorted])
    best_k_sorted = best_k_unsorted[sorted_indices]
    best_k_distances = distances[best_k_sorted]

    return best_k_distances, best_k_sorted
</code></pre>

<p>But that one matrix multiply is doing all the work; the rest is negligible in
comparison.</p>

<p>The brute force strategy is surprisingly viable for small vector stores up
through about 10,000 vectors, but by the time we&rsquo;ve past 100,000 vectors it&rsquo;s
definitely time to switch to something more sophisticated. For this database of
200,000 vectors the HNSW algorithm (which scales as $O(\log n)$ for search) is
more than 100 times faster than brute force.</p>

<p>Not that it really matters for this use case, because whichever we use the
0.3 second latency for calling the OpenAI embeddings API to convert the query
string into a query vector is still going to be the bottleneck.</p>

<h3 id="cross-validation">Cross-Validation</h3>

<p>One thing to consider when benchmarking RAG is that it&rsquo;s not very interesting
to simply prove we can memorize and retrieve 200,000 records - any idiot with a
database could do that. We want our agent to generalize to novel questions it
hasn&rsquo;t seen before. That&rsquo;s definitely possible, because a lot of trivia
questions are actually pretty similar. Jeopardy! doesn&rsquo;t repeat questions
verbatim, but there&rsquo;s plenty to be learned by simply watching the show.</p>

<p>We could split the dataset randomly - with one split feeding the vector
database and the other being used for benchmark questions - but instead we used
the <code>air_date</code> field to do a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html">time series split</a>. All questions from
before the split date are available to the agent via RAG, and all questions
asked on the benchmark are sampled from after the split date.</p>

<p>I picked a date from about a year before the end of the dataset to simulate the
experience of a typical contestant on the show - they would have had access to
questions from prior seasons, but not newer ones.</p>

<h3 id="rag-agent">RAG Agent</h3>

<p>The contestant that we use to benchmark RAG looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@retry_decorator
def mattea(category: str, clue: str) -&gt; str:

<p>It&rsquo;s named after Mattea Roach, the most successful Canadian contestant of all
time.</p>

<p><img src="/post/jeopardy_files/mattea.png"></p>

<p>We also need special handling when it comes time to benchmark <code>mattea()</code>.
Unlike the other agents, we can&rsquo;t simply sample from all the fair questions;
because of split, we must be careful to only sample questions after the split
date:</p>

<pre><code>jeopardy_data = load_jeopardy_dataset(remove_unfair=True)
split_date = '2011-01-01'
jeopardy_new = [ q for q in jeopardy_data if q['air_date'] &gt;= split_date ]
mattea_benchmark_results_df = jeopardy_benchmark(
    contestant=mattea,
    dataset=jeopardy_new,
    sample_size=2000)
</code></pre>

<p>We can then combine Mattea&rsquo;s results with the others to obtain the final
dataset used for the bar chart at the top of this article.</p>

<pre><code>all_benchmark_results_df = pd.concat([
    old_benchmark_results_df, 
    mattea_benchmark_results_df
])
</code></pre>

<p>The logic for this is found in the <a href="https://github.com/olooney/jpt/blob/main/Mattea%20CV%20Benchmark.ipynb">Mattea CV Benchmark</a> notebook.</p>

<p>Now that we understand what the different parts mean, let&rsquo;s take another
look at the summary bar chart:</p>

</table>

<p>The sample size of 2,000 gives us pretty good statistical power. The 95%
confidence interval for each measurement is only a few percentage points wide.</p>

<p>Except for James (gpt-3.5-turbo) and Brad (llama3:70b), who are basically tied,
the difference between successive rows are all statistically significant. That
means its appropriate to treat these differences being meaningful.</p>

<p>Let me wrap this up by giving my thoughts on what this benchmark taught us
about the various different things we tried.</p>

<h3 id="fine-tuning-1">Fine-Tuning</h3>

<p>Fine-tuning works, but it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;you get what you pay for&rdquo; kind of deal.
OpenAI&rsquo;s rates for fine-tuned models are midway between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, but
so is performance. Then there&rsquo;s the headache of curating and maintaining a
fine-tuning dataset&hellip; unless you actually beat a GPT-4 model with your
fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model (which is going to be very use case dependent) it&rsquo;s a
lot of complexity for a very marginal cost savings. &ldquo;Almost as good, and
slightly cheaper&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t have the same ring as &ldquo;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/14l986i/a_blue_light_special/">Almost as good, and a
lot cheaper</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, when OpenAI finally starts offering fine-tuning of GPT-4 models,
fine-tuning may allow us to unlock a whole new level of performance, but that&rsquo;s
future state. Right now it&rsquo;s very situational.</p>

<p>One thing that surprised me about the fine-tuning is that the performance gains
all came from the first few hundred records. The training loss curve flattened
out pretty quickly and there wasn&rsquo;t any benefit from fine-tuning on a larger
10k dataset. That means we&rsquo;re not teaching the model the answers to specific
trivia questions, <em>we&rsquo;re teaching it how to be a Jeopardy! contestant.</em> That&rsquo;s
also why the performance bump generalizes to novel data - it&rsquo;s not about
memorization.  That tells us that fine-tuning is the tool we should reach for
to <em>steer</em> our models: to improve compliance or to stay on task.</p>

<h3 id="rag">RAG</h3>

<p>RAG gives us a whopping <em>15-percentage-point</em> advantage over the baseline
model. It doesn&rsquo;t quite get us all the way up to the performance of the
70-billion-parameter version, but that&rsquo;s still a very impressive gain
especially considering how fast and cost effective it is.</p>

<p>The added 0.3 second latency for hitting the embeddings API is
probably the biggest downside. That latency probably isn&rsquo;t coming from the
actual embedding model; it the typical latency you&rsquo;d see with any HTTP request
that has to make a round trip across the internet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s enough to make me wonder if running a local embedding model would be worth
it for the reduction in latency alone&hellip; Many popular embedding models, such as
OpenAI&rsquo;s or <a href="https://docs.voyageai.com/docs/embeddings">Voyage AI&rsquo;s</a>, are proprietary and require just such a round trip
over HTTP, but there are also open models that do well on benchmarks such as
<a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">MTEB</a>.</p>

<p>The vector database itself is pretty inexpensive to index and essentially free
to query if you use HNSW so unless you&rsquo;re operating at Wikipedia scale the
costs will be nominal; it&rsquo;s really the embeddings call that gets you.</p>

<p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to use RAG with a small model like we did; you could
pair it with GPT-4 or other SOTA if you&rsquo;re focused on quality over throughput,
latency, or cost. Unlike fine-tuning, RAG doesn&rsquo;t lock you into a particular
LLM choice.</p>

<p>I see why there&rsquo;s a lot of hype around RAG and HNSW; it&rsquo;s cheap, it&rsquo;s fast, it
scales well, it&rsquo;s easy to implement (you don&rsquo;t have to hand-curate training
examples but just chunk whatever useful documents are lying around), it&rsquo;s
flexible (you can mix-and-match with any LLM to acheive the right balance of
cost, quality, and speed) and above it <em>works</em>, giving noticeable improvement
in task performance and answer quality.</p>

<h3 id="llama-3">Llama 3</h3>

<p>Llama 3 is definitely behind ChatGPT across the board on this benchmark - the
largest and best performing Llama 3 model is tied with OpenAI&rsquo;s &ldquo;for occasional
use around the home&rdquo; GPT-3.5 model.</p>

<p>Parameter size is likely to have an outsized impact on this particular
benchmark because this kind of knowledge based task heavily handicaps smaller
models - all that world knowledge has to live somewhere - and a lot of the
improvements reportedly made by Llama 3 over Llama 2 are about reasoning and
usability, not breadth of knowledge.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know how large GPT-3.5 is exactly; speculation puts it at around 40
billion parameters, but no one knows for sure. For all I know it&rsquo;s also 70
billion and the only difference between OpenAI and Meta is that OpenAI has
spent more on GPUs. Or it could be that OpenAI has a few secrets that give them
an algorithmic edge.</p>

<p>Regardless of how it&rsquo;s achieved, OpenAI still has the lead, and Meta did not
manage to fully close the gap with Llama 3. At least not on the only benchmark
that really matters, the only benchmark that truly represents an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete">AI-complete</a> measure of general intelligence: the ability to win money on
a TV game show.</p>
