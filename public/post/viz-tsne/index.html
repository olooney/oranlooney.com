<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Visualizing the results of a binary classifier is already a challenge,
but having more than two classes aggravates the matter considerably.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we have $k$ classes. Then for each observation, there is one
correct prediction and $k-1$ possible incorrect prediction. Instead of
a $2 \times 2$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">confusion matrix</a>, we have a $k^2$ possibilities.
Instead of having two kinds of error, false positives and false negatives,
we have $k(k-1)$ kinds of errors. And not all errors are created equal:
just as we choose an optimal balance of false positives and false negatives
depending on the cost associated to each, certain kinds of errors in
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification">multiclass</a> problem will be more or less acceptable. For example, mistaking
a lion for a tiger may be acceptable, but mistaking a tiger for a bunny
may be fatal.</p>

<p>The goal of visualizing multiclass classification results is to allow
the user to quickly and accurately see <em>which</em> errors are occurring
and to start developing theories about <em>why</em> those errors are occurring;
usually this would be to assist the user during iterative model development,
but could also be used, for example, to communicate the behavior of a
final classifier to a non-specialized audience.</p>

<p>In this article I employ two basic strategies to try and meet these goals:
data visualization techniques and algorithmic techniques. It&rsquo;s worth a quick
reminder about why data visualization is valuable at all. The human visual
system is extremely good at picking up certain kinds of patterns (generally
those that correspond to spatial relationships and color), but is completely
unable to see other kinds of patterns (the digits of $\pi$ coded as greyscale
pixel brightness would look like pure noise) and worse yet has a tendency
to see patterns in clouds of purely random data where none exist. A good
visualization, then, ensures that any interesting structure in the underlying
data will be presented in a way that is amenable to interpretation by the
human visual system, while any irrelevant or statistically insignificant
variation is suppressed.</p>

<p>Algorithmic techniques, on the other hand, do
not rely on the human visual system&rsquo;s ability to detect patterns, but automate
the analysis that a human would have done anyway in some procedural way. Rather
than merely making it easy to see where a relationship exists, an algorithmic
solution would explicitly enumerate and rank the kinds of things the user
is interested in. This approach can scale to large data sets much more efficiently,
but requires us to trust the algorithm. Both data visualization and algorithmic
techniques are useful in practice and are often best when combined.</p>

<p>The underlying problem is very open ended and I do not claim to have come up with
any definitive solution, but I did find several novel and useful techniques
that seem to me to be worth sharing.</p>

<h2 id="case-study">Case Study</h2>

<p>To explore the problem, we need some data and a toy classifier to work with.</p>

<p>The first step is to train and fit some reasonably good but not perfect
classifier to some dataset that is reasonably amenable to classification but
not linearly separable.</p>

<p>To meet these requirements, I chose the MNIST handwritten digit dataset; This
data set is popular for testing multiclass classification algorithms and has
the advantage of having very intuitive classes. The MNIST problem is to
classify 28x28 gray scale images, which represent center and scaled images of
handwritten digits, and assign them to one of ten classes, namely the digits 0
through 9. The MNIST data come pre-labeled and therefore ready to be fed into a
supervised learning algorithm. Best of all, it is extremely easy to obtain in an
R-friendly format due to its popularity.</p>

<p>As a preprocessing step, we will use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding">T-SNE</a> algorithm provided by the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsne/index.html">tsne</a> package to reduce the 784 dimensions of the raw pixel data to just
two dimensions, which we will simply call <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<pre><code>mnist_tsne &lt;- tsne(as.matrix(mnist_r10000[,1:784]))
xy &lt;- as.data.frame(mnist_tsne)
colnames(xy) &lt;- c('x', 'y')
xy$label &lt;- mnist_r10000$Label
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we will apply a multinomial classifier from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnet/index.html">nnet</a> package
(despite the name, the package actually provides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLP</a> and multinomial log-linear
models)</p>

<pre><code>model &lt;- multinom(
  label ~ I(x^3) + I(y^3) + I((x^2)*y) + I(x*y^2) + I(x^2) + I(y^2) + x * y, 
  data=xy,
  maxit=500
)
xy$prediction &lt;- predict(model)
hits_and_misses = xy[xy$label != xy$prediction | rep_len(c(TRUE,FALSE), nrow(xy)),]
</code></pre>

<p>This model does an OK but not stellar job of classifying digits, achieving an
overall accuracy of about 95%. This is what we want - a higher quality model
would have too few misses to analyze deeply, while a simpler model wouldn&rsquo;t be
realistic enough to make a good case study.</p>

<h2 id="off-the-shelf-pairs-plot">Off-the-Shelf Pairs Plot</h2>

<p>A good place to start with any dataset is a so-called &ldquo;pairs&rdquo; plot: a grid of
plots showing relationships between every every possible pair of columns. The
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally/index.html">GGally</a> package provides a particularly high-quality pair plot, so let&rsquo;s
start with that.</p>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/xy_pairs.png" alt="GGally Pair Plot" title="GGally Pair Plot" /></p>

<p>This plot was easy to create, but most of the relationships turn out to be
uninteresting, except in a negative sense: we can tell from the large amount of
overlap between classes in the univariate kernel density plots that neither <code>x</code>
nor <code>y</code> alone is able to classify digits very well. However, the leftmost plot
in the middle column, which shows a scatter plot of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> color-coded
with the true class label, suggests that using both dimensions together with a
non-linear classifier may be effective.</p>

<h2 id="scatter-plot">Scatter Plot</h2>

<p>To explore that further, let&rsquo;s create a full-size scatter plot on <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
To compactly and intuitively represent both the <em>true</em> class and the
<em>predicted</em> class in the same plot, we will plot each point with the <a href="https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/unicode">glyph</a>
representing the true class and a color representing the predicted class. To
avoid overwhelming the plot, we plot only a random sample of 1,000 points.</p>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/tsne_10000.png" alt="MNIST Digits T-SNE Coordinates, Color Coded" title="MNIST Digits T-SNE Coordinates, Color Coded" /></p>

<p>Pro: I was able to pack an extra dimension into each point by using a glyph
to represent each point. It&rsquo;s easy to see that predictions form contiguous
regions in the 2D space.</p>

<p>Con: Misses can only be seen by carefully scanning the image for digits with
the wrong color. Because only a sample of data is shown and there are relatively few
misses, it is unclear exactly where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary">decision boundaries</a> are.</p>

<h2 id="2d-kernel-density-plot">2D Kernel Density Plot</h2>

<p>To correct these defects, I next moved away from a scatter plot of the <em>sample</em>
and looked for a way to visualize the underlying <em>distribution</em>. One way to do this
is to compute a two-dimensional kernel density estimate from the underlying
data and to use a contour plot to display the result. Essentially, we
get a &ldquo;hill&rdquo; for the region where a particular class is prevalent. These
regions look like concentric rings, although the rings are very far from circular.
The probability that a given point belongs to any particular class is
proportional to the number of rings of the right color that completely surround
that point. Points which are in the intersection between two regions are ambiguous
and this is where we should expect to see the most misclassifications.</p>

<pre><code>centers &lt;- xy %&gt;% 
  group_by(label) %&gt;% 
  summarise_all(funs(mean))

ggplot(xy[1:1000,], aes(x, y, color=label)) + 
  geom_density_2d() +
  xlim(-120, 125) +
  ylim(-130, 110) +
  geom_text(
    data=centers, 
    aes(x, y, color=label, label=label),
    fontface=&quot;bold&quot;,
    size=10,
    show.legend=FALSE
  ) + 
  theme(legend.position=&quot;bottom&quot;) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) +
  ggtitle(&quot;t-SNE MNIST, 2D Kernel Density&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/tsne_10000_density_2d.png" alt="MNIST Digits Kernel Density Projected into T-SNE space" title="MNIST Digits Kernel Density Projected into T-SNE space" /></p>

<p>Pro: the simple expedient of labelling each centroid with a large color coded digit
makes works well and makes the color legend at the bottom almost unnecessary.</p>

<p>The graph is highly interpretable at a glance, and can also be used to give
precise predictions if you are patient enough to count rings.</p>

<p>It is very easy to see where boundaries overlap and the classification model
may be confused: not the large area of overlap between 3 and 5 on the left, for
example. Such overlaps directly correspond to pairs of classes for which
misclassification is common.</p>

<p>Con: Directionality is rather unclear - if a point is in the overlap of 3 and
5, it is at risk of being misclassified - but will 3&rsquo;s be misclassified as 5&rsquo;s,
vice versa, or both? Also, people do need at least some training
to interpret contour plots, especially <em>overlapping</em> contour plots, which are
not very common at all.</p>

<h2 id="hits-and-misses-plot">Hits and Misses Plot</h2>

<p>Returning to the scatterplot concept and striking out in a different direction, my
next idea was to draw attention to misses by color coding by accuracy instead of by class;
in the below plot: correct predictions are labeled in blue, incorrect in red.</p>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/tsne_recovered_labels.png" alt="hits and misses" title="hits and misses" /></p>

<p>Pro: this variation naturally calls the eye to the misses: Unlike our first
scatterplot the misses now stand out vividly.</p>

<p>It many ways this trick is successful: we can immediately see at a glance that
misclassifications do indeed tend to fall near the boundary of two clusters,
and we also get a sense of where such misses tend to belong to one class or the
other. Finally, we can also easily pick out examples of misclassifications
buried deep within other clusters - such cases are perhaps very far beyond the
current model to correctly classify and represent the irreducible error of the
current approach.</p>

<p>Con: Obviously we gave up the detailed information about the predicted class
that we previously encoded into the color. Many of the criticisms directed
at the previous scatterplot still apply here too.</p>

<h2 id="tree-plot">Tree Plot</h2>

<p>While some of the above visualizations have succeeded at attracting attention
to the signal in the noise, they cannot be said to have algorithmically
extracted the relevant information. The best way I came up with for
doing this was to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering">hierarchical clustering</a> which is sometimes
used for similar problems, such as finding correlation relationships in a
data set.</p>

<p>To apply the algorithm to this problem, I defined classes as &ldquo;closer&rdquo;
to each other each other the more often they are misclassified as each
other. If the algorithm does its job then those classes which are most
likely to be mistaken together will be close together on the resulting tree.
(Graphical plots of tree structures have the slightly pretentious name
of &ldquo;dendrograms,&rdquo; terminology I will never-the-less adopt for precision.)</p>

<pre><code>miss_table &lt;- table(misses$label, misses$prediction)
sym_miss_table &lt;- as.matrix(prop.table(miss_table + t(miss_table)))
diag(sym_miss_table) &lt;- 0.07
sym_dist_table &lt;- round(0.07 - sym_miss_table,4)
miss_dist &lt;- as.dist(round(0.07 - sym_miss_table,4))
plot(hclust(miss_dist, method=&quot;ward.D&quot;))
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/hclust_dendro_ward.png" alt="Dendrogram using Ward's Linkage" title="Dendrogram using Ward's Linkage" /></p>

<p>Pro: I am very pleased to note that this clustering is fundamentally
successful: it correctly pairs 3 with 5, 4 with 9, and so on. These are the
same patterns we observed in the less rigorous analysis above, but we no longer
have to rely on eyeballing the graph and making a subjective judgement.  The
clustering algorithm is explicitly telling us that those are the most prevalent
relationships.</p>

<p>Con: The above relationships are symmetric (as is required by the definition of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)">metric</a>.) The use of a symmetric metric was in turn a requirement of the
agglomerative clustering algorithm we used. We will need a fundamentally
different approach for deal with directionality.</p>

<h2 id="heat-map">Heat Map</h2>

<p>The dendrogram does obscure some of the raw data about the frequency of
misclassifications, however. A standard way to have our cake and eat it to &ndash;
to show both the algorithmic clusters and underling data in the same
visualization &ndash; is to use a heatmap for the raw data, and attach the
dendrograms to the rows and columns.</p>

<pre><code>heatmap(sym_dist_table)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/misses_heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap" title="Heatmap" /></p>

<p>Pro: If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll see that both the row and column dendrograms
are in fact the same dendrogram from before, now being used to order the rows
and columns of a heat map. This brings the 10 classes into a roughly block
matrix form where squares along the diagonal indicate groups of classes that
may be mistaken for one another. But the heatmap shows much more than this - we
can see the isolated, bright red squares along the diagonal in the upper right,
representing the easily classifiable cases. We can see not just pairs, but
larger groups - the 3-5-8 group in the lower left stands out as a 3x3 block of
related classes.</p>

<p>Con: I am very pleased with this visualization, and feel the only thing lacking
is the directionality information we had to discard in order to fit our data
into the hierarchical clustering mold. Let&rsquo;s address that next.</p>

<h2 id="directed-graph">Directed Graph</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s address the directionality issue now by returning to the asymmetric
results matrix, before we applied the symmetry condition, and instead
interpret it as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph.</a>
Then the classes will be the nodes
of the graph and the edges will indicate common misclassifications. We
can use the <a href="http://igraph.org/r/">igraph</a> package to visualize this digraph.</p>

<pre><code>library(igraph)
plot(
    graph_from_adjacency_matrix(t(miss_table &gt; 12), mode='directed'), 
    main=&quot;Digraph: Real -&gt; Mistaken Prediction&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/digraph_miss.png" alt="Digraph of Misses" /></p>

<p>Pro: It makes certain imbalances in misclassification quite evident: while a 5
might be misclassified as a 9, a 9 will almost never be misclassified as a 5.
Such imbalances can be found simply by looking for edges with only one arrow.</p>

<p>Con: Quite difficult to explain to a lay audience. No real sense of relative
probability of each type of error. This graphic does not stand by itself, but
may be a useful companion to the heatmap if directionality is present and
relevant. While not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, it does mean
that we discarded directionality information.</p>

<h2 id="deep-dive-into-misses">Deep Dive into Misses</h2>

<p>The above hierarchy suggests a strong relationship between the classes 3
and 5. We can explore this in depth by taking a random sample of such
misses and plotting them in full.</p>

<p><img src="/post/viz-tsne_files/misses_3_5.png" alt="Misses 3-&gt;5" title="Misses 3-&gt;5" /></p>

<p>Some of these errors are more forgivable than others, but it&rsquo;s clear that the
multinomial algorithm is struggling when a digit is written in such a way as to
shift critical features by a few pixels. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">algorithm</a> that didn&rsquo;t look
at all 784 pixels at once but zoomed in and looked for certain features or
patterns in a translation invariant way would do a much better job&hellip; While I&rsquo;m
not too interested in the particulars of the toy problem, the fact that way to
improve the model is immediately leaps to mind just by looking at a few
examples of misses suggest that this kind of deep dive is a useful diagnostic
supplement.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Performing hierarchical clustering on the $k \times k$ confusion matrix and
displaying the results as a dendrogram was very successful at algorithmically
finding real relationships between classes but hides directionality
information. However, this can be supplemented with a digraph if directionality
is important. I also found that presenting the dendrograms together with a heat
map is an excellent way to visualize both the structure and raw results of a
multiclass classification algorithm. Finally, I found that even a few concrete
examples of each type of hit or miss went a long way towards providing insights
about which cases the classifier could handle and which it could not.</p>
