<p>In 2020, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1oQLPRE21o">Zodiac 340 cipher was finally cracked</a> after more than 50
years of trying by amateur code breakers.  While the effort to crack it was
extremely impressive, the cipher itself was ultimately disappointing. A
<a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/homophonic-substitution-cipher/">homophonic substitution cipher</a> with a minor gimmick of writing
diagonally, the main factor that prevented it from being solved much earlier
was the several errors the Zodiac killer made when encoding it.</p>

<p>Substitution ciphers, which operate at the level of a single character, are
children&rsquo;s toys, the kind of thing you might get a decoder ring for from the
back of a magazine. Homophonic substitution ciphers, which are designed to
prevent frequency analysis by using more than one cipher character to denote
frequent letters, are barely more secure - <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-decipher-50-letters-from-mary-queen-of-scotts-before-her-beheading1/">Mary, Queen of Scots was executed
in 1587 after just such a cipher was intercepted and cracked</a>.</p>

<p>I want to tell you about an alternative cipher, which is much more secure than
a substitution cipher, but still simple enough to encode and decode by hand
quickly. This particular cipher was successfully used as a field cipher in WWI
as it would take hours or days to crack by hand.</p>

<p>And then, of course, we&rsquo;re going to crack it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no practical purpose to this; I wanted to play around with code
breaking techniques, and modern ciphers are too secure to be anything but
discouraging, while substitution ciphers don&rsquo;t present much of a challenge. I
found this to be a rewarding exercise and recommend it to anyone who wants to
play around with hobby-level cryptography.</p>

<h2 id="the-playfair-cipher">The Playfair Cipher</h2>

<p>The cipher in question is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher">Playfair cipher</a>. As you can infer
from its name, it was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854; Playfair merely
popularized it. (Lest you think Wheatstone was cheated out of credit, rest
assured that he received due fame for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge">Wheatstone bridge</a>, which was
invented by Samuel Hunter Christie.)</p>

<p>The Playfair cipher is designed to be done on paper, so places a great
deal of emphasis on ease of use over security. No addition module 256 here!</p>

<p>A Playfair key is a 5x5 grid of unique letters:</p>

<div id="playfairCanvas"><img src="/post/playfair_files/texture.png"></div>

<p>Because there are 26 letters but only 25 spaces, we need to merge two letters;
by convention this is done by replacing J with I. Also, we will have to omit
all punctuation and ignore case. One easy way to generate a key that you can
easily remember is to use a unique phrase or sentence and write it into the
grid from left to right and top to bottom, skipping any duplicate letters and
filling up the rest of the grid with any omitted letters in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>The encryption operates on pairs of letters (which I will refer to as digraphs
from now on.) Let&rsquo;s say the first two letters of your message are &ldquo;SP.&rdquo; You
find those two letters on the grid and imagine they form two corners of a
rectangle, like so:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/rectangle_constraint.png"></p>

<p>Then you simply swap each letter with the unused corner in the same row,
resulting in &ldquo;HR&rdquo; which is our ciphertext. To decrypt ciphertext, you do the
exact same operation.</p>

<p>That covers about 80% of the cases. However, there are a couple of other cases
that can occur. If the letters are in the same row, instead of using the
rectange corner swap, we simply shift each letter one space to the right,
wrapping around to the leftmost column if we go off the right edge. If the
letters are in the same column we shift each down one space, wrapping as
needed. If the two letters are the same, we break them up by inserting a &ldquo;Z&rdquo;
into the message: &ldquo;LLAMA&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;LZLAMA&rdquo; which becomes &ldquo;TFMDYE&rdquo;. If the
duplicate letters happen to be &ldquo;ZZ&rdquo;, use X instead. And finally, if there
are an odd number of letters in your message and you need one more letter to make
a final digraph, stick a Z on the end (or X if the last letter was already a Z.)</p>

<p>These edge cases make the algorithm seem complicated but they rarely come up
and 99% of the time you are just swapping corners or shifting by one within a
row or column. It only takes five or ten minutes to learn the algorithm and
once you do, and practice it a couple times on some moderately long messages,
you&rsquo;ll never forget it.</p>

<p>The reason it&rsquo;s more secure that a substitution cipher is not merely because it
operates two characters at a time, but because it mixes the two values together
in a non-linear (but reversible) way.  Modern block ciphers like AES use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution%E2%80%93permutation_network">substitution-permutation network</a> which work in a very similar way and
are difficult to crack for exactly the same reason.</p>

<p>We can visualize this strength using a heatmap. Here is the structure
of a simple substitution cipher:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/substitution_heatmaps.png"></p>

<p>The patterns are obvious and simple; this cipher is not doing a good job of
hiding the message. In contrast, the heatmap for the Playfair cipher shows
reasonable levels of mixing:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/playfair_heatmaps.png"></p>

<p>How secure is Playfair? Wikipedia has this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Playfair is no longer used by military forces because of the advent of
digital encryption devices. This cipher is now regarded as insecure for any
purpose, because modern computers could easily break it within microseconds.
<br>&mdash;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playfair_cipher">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really, microseconds? I&rsquo;m not so sure about that&hellip; let&rsquo;s be generous and say
we can implement the Playfair decryption using 3 operations, and the bigraph
lookup using 1 operation, all of which hit the L1 cache. That&rsquo;s roughly 4
nanoseconds per bigraph, or 2 nanoseconds per character. We&rsquo;ll need 100
characters or more to have any hope of cracking the cipher, so that&rsquo;s 200
nanoseconds per candidate key that we check. That means we have to find a
solution while checking fewer than 5,000 keys. That&rsquo;s not much of a budget.  I
think the &ldquo;milliseconds&rdquo; used by Wikipedia is simply hyperbole, or perhaps a
confusion between the cost of a decryption vs. the cost of a crack. To see why,
let&rsquo;s try to estimate the strength of a Playfair key from first principles.</p>

<p>At first glance is seems there should be $25! = 1.5 \times 10^{25}$ possible
keys.  However, if we study the algorithm, we see that all of the operations
wrap around at the edges - that is, if the algorithm tells you to move one
column to the right and you&rsquo;re already at the 5th column, you wrap around back
to the first column. The same is true for rows. That means Playfair keys can be
visualized as being on a torus:</p>

<div id="playfairTorus"><img src="/post/playfair_files/torus.png"></div>

<p>We can effectively rotate all the rows or columns of a key an obtain an
equivalent key - they both perform the same encryption and decryption. This
means there there are effectively only $25!/25 = 24! = 6.2 \times 10^{23}$ possible
keys.</p>

<p><link rel="stylesheet" href="/post/playfair_files/playfair.css"></p>

<script type="module">
    import { renderPlayfairCanvas, renderPlayfairTorus } from '/post/playfair_files/playfair_torus.js';
    renderPlayfairTorus('MYNAEISORWLBCDFGHKPQTUVXZ', 'playfairTorus');
</script>

<p>There are, broadly speaking, two ways to attack ciphers. The first is to search
the space of all possible keys, decrypting the ciphertext with each candidate
key and hunting for some kind of leaked information that might betray the fact
that we&rsquo;re getting closer. The second is obtain, by spycraft or guesswork, some
plaintext message for which we also have the corresponding encrypted ciphertext
(although the key is still unknown) and to mathematically deduce the key. We&rsquo;ll
do both, but let&rsquo;s start with the second approach first, as it&rsquo;s more fun - more
like solving a puzzle and less like groping around in the dark.</p>

<h2 id="known-plaintext-attack">Known Plaintext Attack</h2>

<p>Known plaintext attacks sound rather pointless at first glance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
telling me you can crack this cipher for me, but only if I give you the
original message? I think I&rsquo;ll take my business to a different cryptographer.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway.
<br>&mdash;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060508-22/?p=31283">Raymond Chen</a>, quoting Douglas Adams</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there are several ways to obtain probable plaintext. For example, you
might guess it says &ldquo;Keine besonderen Ereignisse,&rdquo; German for &ldquo;Nothing to
Report,&rdquo; a stock phrase often used by Germans in WWII and which was used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma">crack the Enigma machine</a>.  Nor is the exercise pointless - once you&rsquo;ve
cracked the cipher and obtained the secret key you&rsquo;ll be able to use that key
to decrypt and read other messages that you don&rsquo;t yet know, as well as encrypt
fake messages.</p>

<p>Stack Overflow user Ilmari Karonen has helpfully <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/35722/how-to-find-the-keyword-of-the-playfair-cipher-given-the-plaintext-and-the-ciph">summarized the logic
here</a>.  Some of the tricks are obvious, but others, like the chains
which allow us to fill in an entire row or column, including the exact order,
are extremely clever.</p>

<p>We have options about how we represent this problem to Z3. I found the most
natural way was to use a 25x2 matrix, where each row represents a letter. The
first column is the x-coordinate of that letter in the 5x5 playfair key grid,
and the second is the y-coordinate. So every element of the matrix will be an
integer between 0 and 4, and we&rsquo;ll also need to make sure that a letter can go
in one and only one cell.  Because the constraints apply to all Playfair key
grids, we&rsquo;ll call them the universal constraints.</p>

<pre><code>from z3 import *

X = [[Int('x_%i_%i' % (i, j)) for j in range(2)] for i in range(25)]
position_constraints = [
    And(0 &lt;= X[i][j], X[i][j] &lt;= 4) 
    for j in range(2) 
    for i in range(25)
] 
distinct_constraints = [
    Distinct([X[i][0]*5 + X[i][1] 
    for i in range(25)])
]
universal_constraints = position_constraints + distinct_constraints
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll write some helper function so help keep track of the constraints. Most of
the information will come in the form of learning that two letters are in the
same row/column, or in adjacent rows/columns, so we&rsquo;ll make it easy to describe
such constraints.</p>

<pre><code>def row_col_constraint(*indices, spacing=0, orientation=0):
    constraints = [
        (X[indices[i]][orientation] + spacing) % 5 == X[indices[i+1]][orientation] 
        for i in range(len(indices) - 1)
    ]
    if len(constraints) &gt;= 2:
        return And(*constraints)
    else:
        return constraints[0]

def same_row(*indices):
    return row_col_constraint(*indices, spacing=0, orientation=0)

def same_col(*indices):
    return row_col_constraint(*indices, spacing=0, orientation=1)

def next_row(*indices):
    return row_col_constraint(*indices, spacing=1, orientation=0)

def next_col(*indices):
    return row_col_constraint(*indices, spacing=1, orientation=1)
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have to consider the various special cases. For example, if we see that
the plaintext &ldquo;XY&rdquo; maps to ciphertext &ldquo;AB&rdquo;, and we also see that &ldquo;AB&rdquo; maps to
&ldquo;XY&rdquo;, then we know that X, Y, A, B must form a rectangle in the key grid.</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/rectangle_constraint.png"></p>

<p>This gives us information about which letters <em>must</em> share a row or column,
and we can encode this information as Z3 constraints:</p>

<pre><code># XY -&gt; AB and AB -&gt; XY, so XA/BY form a rectangle
def rectangle_constraint(plain_digraph: str, cipher_digraph: str) -&gt; list:
    p1, p2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in plain_digraph)
    c1, c2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in cipher_digraph)

    return And(
        same_row(p1, c1),
        same_row(p2, c2),
        same_col(p1, c2),
        same_col(p2, c1),
        Not(same_row(p1, p2)),
        Not(same_col(p1, p2)),
        Not(same_row(c1, c2)),
        Not(same_col(c1, c2))
    )
</code></pre>

<p>There are several other such special cases to consider. Such as this chain constraints three in a row, either in a column or row:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/chain_constraint.png"></p>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre><code># XY -&gt; PQ, PQ -&gt; YA =&gt; row/col of XPYQA
def chain_constraint(plain_digraph: str, cipher_digraph: str, next_digraph) -&gt; list:
    p1, p2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in plain_digraph)
    c1, c2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in cipher_digraph)
    n1, n2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in next_digraph)

    return Or(
        And(same_row(p1, c1, p2, c2, n2), next_col(p1, c1, p2, c2, n2)),
        And(same_col(p1, c1, p2, c2, n2), next_row(p1, c1, p2, c2, n2))
    )

# XY -&gt; PQ, PQ -&gt; BX =&gt; row/col of YQXPB
# omitted for brevity...

# XY -&gt; YZ so XYZ share a row or column and are all adjacent
def adjacent_constraint(plain_digraph: str, cipher_digraph: str) -&gt; list:
    p1, p2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in plain_digraph)
    c1, c2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in cipher_digraph)
    assert p2 == c1

    return Or(
        And(same_row(p1, p2, c2), next_col(p1, p2, c2)),
        And(same_col(p1, p2, c2), next_row(p1, p2, c2))
    )

# XY -&gt; WX so YXW share a row or column and are all adjacent
# omitted for brevity...
</code></pre>

<p>However, even if we don&rsquo;t see any special pattern, we do actually glean a small
amount of information from every digraph we see. Remember, there are only three
cases for encoding a pair: the rectangle case, the same row case, and the same column case.
In all three, the ciphertext letter is <em>always</em> in the same row or the same column as
the plaintext letter. If it&rsquo;s the same column, then the ciphertext letter is immediately
below the plaintext character:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/simple_constraint.png"></p>

<p>This is true for both the first and second character of each digraph.  In code:</p>

<pre><code># XY -&gt; AB (no other information)
def simple_constraint(plain_digraph: str, cipher_digraph: str) -&gt; list:
    p1, p2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in plain_digraph)
    c1, c2 = (playfair_ord(c) for c in cipher_digraph)

    return And(
        Or(same_row(p1, c1), And(same_col(p1, c1), next_row(p1, c1))),
        Or(same_row(p2, c2), And(same_col(p2, c2), next_row(p2, c2)))
    )
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to scan through the known text and quickly build up a map of digraphs. This is also
a good opportunity to validate that the ciphertext really does look like it came from Playfair cipher.</p>

<pre><code>def parse_bigraph_map(plaintext: str, ciphertext: str) -&gt; dict:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Parse and validate matching plaintext and ciphertext. A dict of distinct
    plaintext to ciphertext bigraphs mappings are returned, including all 
    mirrored mappings. This checks for obvious violations of the Playfair
    cipher algorithm and will raise an Exception if any are found.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

    # we only care about unique/distinct digraph mappings of the form AB -&gt; XY 
    # and will ignore duplicates.
    bigraph_map = {}
    for plain_bigraph, cipher_bigraph in zip(bigraphs(plaintext), bigraphs(ciphertext)):
        # XY -&gt; AB =&gt; YX -&gt; BA, add both the original and mirrored versions to the map
        bigraph_map[plain_bigraph] = cipher_bigraph
        bigraph_map[ plain_bigraph[::-1] ] = cipher_bigraph[::-1]

    return bigraph_map
</code></pre>

<p>We have to examine each digraph mapping to see if we have enough information to identify a special
case:</p>

<pre><code>def constraints_from_known_text(plaintext: str, ciphertext: str, verbose_level=0) -&gt; list:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Analyze the plain/ciphertext bigraph pairs of a message and make deductions about
    the structure of the key. These are returns as a list of Z3 constraints.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    bigraph_map = parse_bigraph_map(plaintext, ciphertext)

    # build up constraints
    constraints = []
    seen_already = set()
    for plain_bigraph, cipher_bigraph in bigraph_map.items():
        # we only need to handle one of each mirror version.
        if plain_bigraph[::-1] in seen_already:
            continue
        else:
            seen_already.add(plain_bigraph)

        # XY -&gt; YZ =&gt; XYZ in row or col
        if plain_bigraph[1] == cipher_bigraph[0]:
            constraints.append( adjacent_constraint(plain_bigraph, cipher_bigraph) )
            continue

</code></pre>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built up a set of Z3 constraints describing our specific problem, we can ask Z3 to find
a key meeting all of the above constraints:</p>

<pre><code>def solve_playfair_constraints(dynamic_constraints):
    solver = Solver()

    solver.add(universal_constraints)
    solver.add(dynamic_constraints)

    # Check for solution
    check = solver.check()
    if  check == sat:
        model = solver.model()
        grid = model_to_grid(model)
        return sat, grid
    else:
        return check, None
</code></pre>

<p>We can also get Z3 to keep generating different unique solutions through the simple trick of
adding a constraint to block the previous solution and re-solving:</p>

<pre><code>def iter_playfair_constraints(dynamic_constraints):
    solver = Solver()

    solver.add(universal_constraints)
    solver.add(dynamic_constraints)

    # Check for solution
    while True:
        check = solver.check()
        if  check == sat:
            model = solver.model()
            grid = model_to_grid(model)
            yield grid

            # block the found solution and try again
            solver.add(Or([
                X[i][j] != model[X[i][j]] 
                for i in range(25) 
                for j in range(2)
            ]))
        else:
            break
</code></pre>

<p>When given only the first 100 characters as known plaintext, this approach was able to recover
almost the entire key, except for a transposition of Z and X in the last row.</p>

<pre><code>M Y N A E
I S O R W
L B C D F
G H K P Q
T U V Z X
</code></pre>

<p>This is enough to recover most of the message:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/kpa_visual_diff.png"></p>

<p>I was very impressed with Z3&rsquo;s capabilities for this task. It was quite easy to express
the constraints in its DSL and its performance was really good. The exact time it takes
to find a key depends on how many characters of known plaintext we are able to provide;
it usually requires about 100 to identify the correct key (or at least one close enough
to work in practice) and that only takes a few seconds. However, that&rsquo;s still three orders
of magnitude out from the &ldquo;microseconds&rdquo; the Wikipedia article claimed, and tracking down
known plaintext is kind of a pain, so let&rsquo;s try another approach.</p>

<h2 id="guessing-plaintext">Guessing Plaintext</h2>

<p>As the Wikipedia article points out, one way of acquiring probable plaintext
sequences from Playfair ciphertext is to make educated guesses at known
plaintext from patterns in the ciphertext.</p>

<p>First, and most obviously, Playfair always encrypts a given digraph to the same
ciphertext everywhere in the message. So if we see ciphertext of the form
&ldquo;XY????XY&rdquo;, where the digraph XY shows up twice with an even number of letters
between them, then we know that the plaintext has some other digraph, say AB,
with the same number of letters between them: &ldquo;AB????AB&rdquo;. Of course, we don&rsquo;t
know that it&rsquo;s AB <em>per se</em>; it could be RE or CH. All we know is that there is a
repetition in the plaintext as well.</p>

<p>Second, and only slightly less obviously, digraph encryption is symmetrical: if
Playfair encrypts a digraph &ldquo;AB&rdquo; as &ldquo;XY&rdquo;, then it must also encrypt &ldquo;BA&rdquo; as
&ldquo;YX&rdquo;. Therefore, if we see ciphertext with the pattern &ldquo;XY????XY&rdquo;, then we
know the plaintext follows the pattern &ldquo;AB????BA&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The reason this is useful is because there are a limited number of words in
the English language that match these patterns. For example, here is a list
set of common English words having a gap of two letters between such patterns:</p>

<pre><code>BAseBAll
CHurCH
DEciDE
EDitED
PErsPEctive
POstPOsted
REtiREment
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we see a pattern like &ldquo;XY??XY&rdquo;. If we guess that this matches
&ldquo;postposted&rdquo; - that gives us 10 characters of known plain text to work with.</p>

<p>I wrote a program to identify all common English words containing such patterns:</p>

<pre><code>import re

def has_digraph_pair(word: str, flipped=False):
    if flipped:
        pattern = r'(.)(.)(.*)\2\1'
    else:
        pattern = r'(.)(.)(.*)\1\2'

    match = re.match(pattern, word)
    if match:
        return (match.group(1) + match.group(2)), len(match.group(3))
    else:
        return '', 0

digraph_pair_index = {}
with open('count_1w.txt', 'r') as file:
    for index, line in enumerate(file.readlines()):
        word, freq = line.split()
        for flipped in (True, False):
            digraph, gap = has_digraph_pair(word, flipped)
            if digraph:
                key = (flipped, gap)
                candidates = digraph_pair_index.get(key, [])
                candidates.append( (word, digraph, index, int(freq)) )
                digraph_pair_index[key] = candidates
</code></pre>

<p>The program identified 161 words in all, but for any given pattern (gap length
&amp; flipped or not) there are usually only about a dozen words to try. I estimate
the prevalence of such patterns is about one matching pattern for every 75
characters of ciphertext, so if you have 1,000 characters of ciphertext, you
might expect to find 13 matching patterns, each of which given you a dozen or
so words to try that might or might not yield about 10 characters of known
plaintext.</p>

<p>The problem, as I see it, is that there is a combinatoric explosion of different
combinations to try. For the pattern XYXY you might guess &ldquo;immigration&rdquo;, for
a separate pattern WZ????ZW you might try &ldquo;students&rdquo;, for UV??????VU you might
try &ldquo;researchers&rdquo;, and so on. But you&rsquo;d have to try every possible combination and
run the KPA attack for each one. It&rsquo;s possible but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like the most
efficient approach, so even though I think this approach is very clever, I decided
to give up on it and not take it any further.</p>

<h2 id="a-sense-of-rightness">A Sense of Rightness</h2>

<p>More importantly, how do we know if we&rsquo;re getting close? Detecting correct
English is pretty easy; how do we detect partially decrypted, garbled English
and distinguish it from pure gibberish?</p>

<p>The FBI, in a report on Graysmith&rsquo;s 1979 attempt to crack the Zodiac 340
cipher, made this rather damning statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a cryptogram has been decrypted properly there is an unmistakable sense
of rightness about the solution. This sense of rightness is completely absent
in the proposed solution.  <br>&mdash; <a href="http://zodiackillerfacts.com/main/the-340-cipher-dead-ends/">FBI</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we are to automate the search, we need to quantify this &ldquo;sense of
rightness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The traditional approach is to use trigrams or quadgrams and compare
frequencies against the known frequencies of a target language such as English.
For example, the trigram &ldquo;THE&rdquo; is very common in English, while &ldquo;QXZ&rdquo; is very
uncommon, so if we see &ldquo;THE&rdquo; in the recovered plaintext we can know we are
on the right track.</p>

<p>An out-of-the-box approach might work to a certain degree, but is far from
optimal. To do a better job, we need to think carefully about the specifics of
the Playfair algorithm.</p>

<p>First, the pre-processing steps of replacing &ldquo;J&rdquo; with &ldquo;I&rdquo; and breaking up pairs
like &ldquo;LL&rdquo; by inserting an &ldquo;X&rdquo; to get &ldquo;LX&rdquo; mess up the frequencies a bit. If
we&rsquo;re going to use n-grams, we should recalculate frequency based on already
pre-processed text. Second, Playfair works on pairs of letters. Especially very
early in the search process, it&rsquo;s a promising signal if any pair of letters
decodes to a common English bigram. However, bigrams are a fairly weak way of
detecting correct text. The code for this is fairly pedestrian so is omitted
here, but you can read the source code if you like.</p>

<p>As an aside, I tried using ChatGPT (via the OpenAI API) to detect English. This
works but is very slow - multiple seconds to check one message, when we need to
be trying thousands or even millions of keys.  However, it does work really
well; ChatGPT can segment and punctuate text that&rsquo;s been run together, and even
tell if a message is messy/malformed English or complete gibberish. This is
actually quite impressive because word segmentation is a classic example of a
problem that needs something like dynamic programming to do efficiently, but
ChatGPT can somehow do it with a single forward pass through the text.</p>

<pre><code>@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))
def punctuate(text: str) -&gt; Tuple[str, str]:

            understanding, your task is to punctuate and format the
            following unpunctuated and unformatted text. Insert whitespace

            exclamation points, and question marks. Do not change letters,

</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, we need to check thousands of texts per second during the course
of a single crack, and ChatGPT is both far too slow and far too expensive to do
that. Therefore the ChatGPT approach was dropped in favor of more heuristic but
much more performant algorithms.</p>

<p>I found a good compromise was to apply word segmentation, and then to check the
resulting words against an English dictionary, with partial credit for typos or
misspellings (which may be decryption errors, or intentional mistakes designed
to make the message harder to crack.) For this purpose we use an off-the-shelf
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/wordsegment/">Python package for word segmentation</a>, implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK-tree">BK-tree</a> to
find English words and near words, and wrote a heuristic function to gauge the
&ldquo;Englishness&rdquo; of a text:</p>

<pre><code>def english_word_score(word: str) -&gt; int:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Score the given word based on its presence in English language and its
    edit distance from English words.

    The scoring strategy is as follows:

    1. If the word is in the set of English words, it's given a score equal
       to its length.
    2. If the word is not in the English words set but is within an edit
       distance of 1 (according to the Damerau-Levenshtein distance) from a
       word in the set, its score is two-thirds of its length.
    3. If the closest edit distance is 2, its score is one third its
       length.
    4. Otherwise, its score is 0.

    Args:
        word (str): The word to score. 
            Only alphabetic characters are considered. Case is ignored.

    Returns:
        int: Score of the word.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Only consider alphabetic characters and ignore case
    word = re.sub(r'[^a-z]', '', word.lower())

    if word in english_words_lower_alpha_set:
        return len(word)
    elif len(word) &gt; 2 and english_bk_tree.search(word, n=1, max_results=1):
        return len(word) * 2/3
    elif len(word) &gt; 3 and  english_bk_tree.search(word, n=2, max_results=1):
        return len(word) * 1/3
    else:
        return 0


def percent_english(segmented_text: str, power=1.5):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Returns the approximate percentage of the text which is comprised of
    full english words.

    Args:
        text (str)   : The segmented text.  If not already clean and
            segmented, use `scrub()` and `segment()` first.
        power (float): Defaults 1.5. Raises each word score to this power,
            giving more weight to longer words. We recommend a power between
            1.0 and 2.0.

    Returns:
        float: Percentage between 0 and 1.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    # Segment the text
    segmented_words = segmented_text.split(&quot; &quot;)

    # Sum the lengths of English words
    english_char_count = sum(english_word_score(word)**power for word in segmented_words)

    # Total character count (excluding spaces)
    total_char_count = sum(len(word)**power for word in segmented_words)

    # Calculate the percentage
    percentage = (english_char_count / total_char_count)

    return percentage
</code></pre>

<p>This approach is still a little slow (still less than a second) but seemingly
quite reliable. Nonsense gets scores under 10%, while even very bad/malformed
English usually gets over 80%.  It&rsquo;s not fast enough to use for inner loop of
the search, but it is fast and reliable enough to automatically detect when
we&rsquo;ve truly cracked the cipher, and so can be used as a final check to decide
when to stop. (This is surprisingly difficult!)</p>

<p>To summarize, we automate the &ldquo;sense of rightness&rdquo; using a threefold approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use bigrams, but only on pairs of letters decoded together. This helps early on.</li>
<li>Also use trigrams, to help zero in on the final key once it starts to make sense.</li>
<li>Finally, use a slower method to verify that we&rsquo;ve found a real English sentence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these scoring techniques, we can do a good enough job identifying English
text to tell if we are making progress on the crack or not. The next step
is to use this information to guide us towards the correct solution.</p>

<h2 id="simulated-annealing">Simulated Annealing</h2>

<p>Before we talk about the Playfair crack itself, let&rsquo;s discuss optimization in
more general terms. There are a ton of optimization algorithms, but many of them
require the objective function to be of a special form (linear or quadratic,
say) or require you to have access to the first or even second order
derivative.  If all you have is some opaque, non-linear, non-convex function
without a known gradient, you&rsquo;re in the realm of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization">derivative-free optimization</a>.</p>

<p>We also have the problem that our input is a discrete string, not a continuous
space, which further rules out many of the options. Of the remaining algorithms,
I chose simulated annealing as being a good fit.</p>

<p>Simulated annealing is actually quite an interesting and powerful technique.
Consider this function:</p>

<p>\[
    f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{1000} \frac{{|\sin(k\pi x)|}}{k}
\]</p>

<p>Or in Python:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x, n=1000):
    return sum( abs(sin(k*pi*x))/k  for k in range(1, n+1) )
</code></pre>

<p>This function has 84,779 local minima between 0.2 and 0.8:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/many_local_minima.png"></p>

<p>Now, I know that as a human, you can easily see that the true global minima is
at 0.5, and a mathematician could easily prove this from the form of the
function above. But let&rsquo;s pretend that this function is opaque and see how the
optimization algorithms do without human insight.  From that point of view,
this is a pathological function that is known to confuse most gradient descent
style algorithms.</p>

<p>However, let&rsquo;s take a stab at it with simulated annealing, which we can
easily do with scipy:</p>

<pre><code>from scipy.optimize import dual_annealing
dual_annealing(f, [(0.2, 0.8)], x0=[0.20001], callback=print)
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>[0.5008241] [4.56639717] 0
[0.5] 4.089060034436875 1
 message: ['Maximum number of iteration reached']
 success: True
  status: 0
     fun: 4.089060034436875
       x: [ 5.000e-01]
     nit: 1000
    nfev: 2145
    njev: 72
    nhev: 0
</code></pre>

<p>The final solution found is that <code>x</code> value of 0.5, which it found in a few milliseconds
starting from a random initial point. It&rsquo;s very powerful!</p>

<p>Intuitively, the way the algorithm works is by starting from some initial point and evaluating
the score function at that point. Then, it makes a change to that point and re-evaluates.
If the score improved, great; we&rsquo;ll keep the new point. If the score got worse, then we have
a tougher judgment call to make. At the beginning of search, we don&rsquo;t mind going downhill
sometimes - we have to if we want to avoid getting stuck in local minima. Our priority at
first is the explore the whole space. However, later on, once we&rsquo;ve found a &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo;
solution, we&rsquo;ll want to build on that. We might be willing to accept a lateral move or even
a slightly downward one, but late in the search we&rsquo;ll want to avoid throwing away all our
hard work.</p>

<p>Simulated annealing&rsquo;s solution to the differing priorities early and late in
the search is to introduce a &ldquo;temperature&rdquo; which measures our willingness to
move downhill. We start at a high temperature and will often accept downward
moves in order to explore the full space, but as the temperature decreases
we&rsquo;ll become more conservative and reject moves that seem like we&rsquo;ll losing too
much progress. (This, in some way that I don&rsquo;t know enough metallurgy to fully
understand, parallels the annealing process that occurs when a material is
treated by being heated and cooled.)</p>

<p>When cracking Playfair ciphers, the space we&rsquo;re exploring is the space of all possible
keys, which are distinct permutations of the 25 letters of the alphabet (I and J are merged
into one to fit the 5x5 grid.) This is a discrete space, but in many ways acts like high
dimensional space. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in high dimensional spaces, and it&rsquo;s possible
to wander away from a &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; key and not be able to find your way back. Therefore,
we also implement a &ldquo;restart patience&rdquo; concept, where we forcibly reset to the best known
solution if we&rsquo;ve been wandering blindly for a while and seem to have lost our way.</p>

<p>This function, together with digraph/trigraph scoring is able to crack Playfair ciphers, but it takes
several minutes, even up to half an hour. We need it to be a lot faster.</p>

<h2 id="parallel">Parallel</h2>

<p>One obvious way to get more performance is to run many searches in parallel. I could have done this
the easy way and simply kicked off a number of independent searches each seeded with a different
random starting key, but I didn&rsquo;t like the way most of the processes would be flailing around blindly
while one process ended up doing all the work. That meant implementing some coordination mechanisms
so that processes that weren&rsquo;t having any luck would be recycled and used to &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; the current best
solution. This involved Python&rsquo;s <code>multiprocessing</code> package to share locks and values across processes,
but it ended up being worth it. The swarming approach really made a huge difference in the total time
to find a correct solution.</p>

<p>Here is what the output typical run looks like. You can see the &ldquo;percent english&rdquo; column on the far right steadily ticking
upwards, and you can see from the process ID in the second column that more than one process is contributing even in
the final seconds of the crack, demonstrating the power of the swarming approach. Personally, I really enjoy watching
recognizable words start to appear in the sample plaintext in the fourth column; it&rsquo;s oddly hypnotic.</p>

<p>At the end, you can see the word segmentation and &ldquo;percent English&rdquo; functions evaluating the final cracked plaintext;
if this check fails, the whole process simply resets from scratch. (Due to the randomization involved, it does sometimes
get stuck, and resetting is often the kindest thing we can do.) That means you can simply &ldquo;fire and forget&rdquo; and
trust the algorithm and its &ldquo;sense of rightness&rdquo; to know when the cipher has been successfully cracked.</p>

<p>However, even with parallelization, (which gives me a 12x speed-up on this machine, and theoretically a lot more
if I rented a beefy AWS compute instance) this is still taking minutes to crack, not seconds. So let&rsquo;s see what
other optimizations we can make.</p>

<h2 id="cython">Cython</h2>

<p>Python is very slow at character-by-character string manipulation. Unfortunately,
that&rsquo;s exactly what the inner loop of <code>Playfair.decrypt()</code> is doing. We can use Cython
to optimize the performance critical section of the code:</p>

<pre><code>@cython.boundscheck(False)
@cython.wraparound(False)
cpdef str playfair_decrypt(str cipher_text, str key):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Decrypt the given cipher text using the Playfair cipher with the provided key.

    Arguments:
    cipher_text -- The encrypted text. Must contain an even number of uppercase letters.
    key -- The key for decryption. Must be exactly 25 uppercase letters.

    Returns:
    The decrypted text.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    cdef int i, j
    cdef int n = len(cipher_text)

    # populate a reverse lookup table
    cdef int[25][2] reverse_lookup
    for i in range(25):
        j = playfair_ord(key[i])
        reverse_lookup[j][0] = i // 5
        reverse_lookup[j][1] = i % 5

    # Allocate memory for the result
    cdef char* decrypted_text = &lt;char*&gt;malloc(n+1)
    if not decrypted_text:
        raise MemoryError()

    # decrypt playfair cipher
    cdef int x1, x2, y1, y2
    try:
        # Loop over the characters in cipher_text
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            x1, y1 = reverse_lookup[playfair_ord(cipher_text[i])]
            x2, y2 = reverse_lookup[playfair_ord(cipher_text[i+1])]

            if x1 == x2:
                decrypted_text[i] = key[5*x1 + (y1-1)%5]
                decrypted_text[i+1] = key[5*x2 + (y2-1)%5]
            elif y1 == y2:
                decrypted_text[i] = key[5*((x1-1)%5) + y1]
                decrypted_text[i+1] = key[5*((x2-1)%5) + y2]
            else:
                decrypted_text[i] = key[5*x1 + y2]
                decrypted_text[i+1] = key[5*x2 + y1]

        # Null-terminate the string
        decrypted_text[n] = b'\0'

        # Convert the byte array back to a Python string to return it
        return decrypted_text.decode('utf-8')

    finally:
        # Free the allocated memory
        free(decrypted_text)
</code></pre>

<p>This worked like magic and resulted in a significant speed-up. It did have
some downsides; this version is extremely brittle and will segfault if the input
ciphertext or key do not exactly match what it expects - for example, if the
ciphertext is an odd number of characters. You&rsquo;ll notice that is largely my own
fault - I&rsquo;m explicitly turning off bounds checking for example - but could easily
be avoided by implementing a few simple sanity checks before entering the hot,
Cython optimized, section of the code. Because in theory the ciphertext is
coming from the wild, I thought it would be useful to write these sanity checks
in a user-friendly way so that any problems in the ciphertext (which may indeed
indicate that the ciphertext isn&rsquo;t from Playfair at all, but some other algorithm
entirely) can be reported to the user:</p>

<pre><code>def playfair_ciphertext_violations(text: str) -&gt; list:
    violations = []

    other_characters = len(re.findall(r'[^a-ik-zA-IK-Z\s]', text))
    if other_characters:
        violations.append(
            f&quot;Text contains {other_characters} characters not used by Playfair.&quot;)

    text = scrub(text)

    # Check for even length
    if len(text) % 2 != 0:
        violations.append(&quot;Text length is not even.&quot;)

    # Check for double letters
    double_letters = 0
    for digraph in pairs(text):
        if len(digraph) == 2:
            if digraph[0] == digraph[1]:
                double_letters += 1        
    if double_letters:
        violations.append(
            f&quot;Text contains {double_letters} invalid double letters.&quot;)

    # Check for more than 25 unique characters
    unique_characters = len(set(text))
    if  unique_characters &gt; 25:
        violations.append(
            f&quot;Text contains {unique_characters} unique letters, &quot;
             &quot;more than the 25 used by Playfair ciphers.&quot;)

    # check for letter J
    if 'J' in text:
        violations.append(
            &quot;Text contains letter 'J', which is not used by Playfair ciphers.&quot;)

    # Check for ciphertext length
    length = len(text)
    if length &lt; 100:
        violations.append(
            f&quot;Text contains only c{length} characters and may be too short to crack.&quot;)

    return violations

<h2 id="hyperparameter-optimization">Hyperparameter Optimization</h2>

<p>While I&rsquo;m very happy with the parallelization and Cython micro-optimization, I
still have a nagging doubt about the simulated annealing algorithm itself. You
see, I had to specify a number of parameters, the most important of which was
the temperature schedule. I played around a little by hand to make sure the
values weren&rsquo;t crazy, but the algorithm was so slow back then
that I really only tried a handful of values. Now that the algorithm is fairly
performant, this is the perfect time to go back and make sure we&rsquo;re using the
best possible hyperparameters.</p>

<p>To do this, we&rsquo;ll use one of my favorite libraries, <a href="http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/">hyperopt</a>. Hyperopt
also uses derivative-free optimization, but it takes a different approach than
simulated annealing. It uses a Bayesian approach to construct a Gaussian
process proxy function to approximate the true function being optimized, and
uses that proxy function to guide its search towards the most promising regions
of the hyperparameter space.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why I chose a completely different algorithm for this
part, when I&rsquo;d already used simulated annealing to solve a very similar problem
above. The reason is that in this case, evaluating the true objective function
is <em>very</em> expensive - 30 seconds instead of milliseconds - and the hyperparameter
space is low-dimensional and continuous instead of high-dimensional and discrete.
So while the optimization problems are technically in the same category, the
specifics of each problem lead to a different choice of algorithm.</p>

<p>Here is the inner core of the objective function, where we simply attempt
the crack with specified parameters:</p>

<pre><code>def crack(ciphertext, params):
    for _ in range(MAX_ATTEMPTS):
        key, score = mp.parallel_crack(
            ciphertext,
            initial_temperature=params['initial_temperature'],
            cooling_rate=params['cooling_rate']
        )
        score, english = evaluate(ciphertext, key)
        if english &gt; mp.acceptance_threshold:
            break
    return key, score, english
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we&rsquo;re actually optimizing for how <em>quickly</em> we can crack the
cipher; we&rsquo;ll measure the clock time it takes to run, and use that
as the &ldquo;loss&rdquo; returned from the objective function.</p>

<pre><code>def objective(params):
    for i in range(N_REPEATS):

        # create a new problem each repeat
        true_key = PlayfairCipher.make_random_key()
        cipher = PlayfairCipher(true_key)
        ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)

        # measure time to crack
        start_time = time.time()
        key, score, english = crack(ciphertext, params)
        end_time = time.time()
        duration = end_time - start_time

    # hyperopt boilerplate omitted 

    return {
        'loss': df['duration'].mean(),
        'loss_variance': df['duration'].var(),
        'status': STATUS_OK,
        # other metrics omitted
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With our objective function fleshed out, let&rsquo;s ask <code>hyperopt</code> to find us the optimal parameters:</p>

<pre><code>def hyperoptimize(trials=None):
    if trials is None:
        trials = Trials()

    space = {
        'initial_temperature': hp.loguniform(
            'initial_temperature', 
            low=np.log(1e-5), 
            high=np.log(1e-3)),
        'cooling_rate': hp.loguniform(
            'cooling_rate', 
            low=np.log(0.0001), 
            high=np.log(0.0003)),
    }

    best = fmin(
        fn=objective,
        space=space,
        algo=tpe.suggest,
        trials=trials,
        max_evals=N_TRIALS)

    return best, trials
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like there is a clear but not particularly strong minimum:</p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/hyperopt_initial_temperature.png"></p>

<p><img src="/post/playfair_files/hyperopt_cooling_rate.png"></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s okay; hyperparameter optimization is often more about having confidence
that you haven&rsquo;t left any easy wins on the table than finding some secret
combination of hyperparameters that magically give you 10X performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that the &ldquo;microseconds&rdquo; used in the Wikipedia article is hyperbole.
That&rsquo;s only enough time to try a handful of keys, and Playfair is not
<em>so</em> weak that you can zero in on the solution that quickly. Nor is the problem
&ldquo;embarrassingly parallel&rdquo; - you can run lots of parallel attacks across a large
server farm, but you can&rsquo;t run $24!$ separate processes, or even make a dent
in it with brute force. You have to use something clever like simulated annealing
or constraint solving, and those are fundamentally sequential.</p>

<p>Still, the Playfair cipher is indeed quite weak - an amateur cryptographer with a
desktop and a couple of free weekends can write a program which will crack
it in under a minute. Don&rsquo;t use it for your important secrets! But do use it
for fun and games, as it&rsquo;s delightful.</p>

<p>One surprising thing I learned is that ChatGPT can solve the word segmentation
problem quite well, and it can even add punctuation and capitalization back
into the message. While LLMs  are far too slow to participate in the
performance-intensive crack (we can use simpler heuristics like trigrams for
that,) their ability to make semantic sense of partially mangled text might
still be useful in automating the &ldquo;sense of rightness&rdquo; which hitherto has been
left to human cryptographers.</p>
