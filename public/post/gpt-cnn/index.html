<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">fact</a>: GPT-4o charges 170 tokens to process each <code>512x512</code> tile
used in high-res mode. (Let&rsquo;s ignore the 85 tokens for the low-res master
thumbnail for now.) At 0.75 tokens/word, this suggests a picture is worth about
227 words - only a factor of four off from the traditional saying.</p>

<p>OK, but <em>why</em> 170? It&rsquo;s an oddly specific number. Numbers that are just dropped
into the codebase without explanation are called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">magic numbers</a>&rdquo; in
programming, and 170 is a pretty glaring magic number.</p>

<p>And why the heck are image costs even being converted to token counts anyway?
If it were just for billing purposes, wouldn&rsquo;t it be less confusing to simply
list the cost per tile?</p>

<p>What if OpenAI chose 170, not as part of some arcane pricing strategy, but
simply because it&rsquo;s literally true? What if image tiles are represented
internally as 170 consecutive tokens? And if so, how?</p>

<h2 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h2>

<p>The first thing to recall about the transformer model is that it operates on
feature vectors, not discrete tokens. They <em>have</em> to be vectors, or the dot
product similarity at the heart of transformers wouldn&rsquo;t make any sense. Tokens
are converted to feature vectors by an embedding model before they even hit the
first layer of the transformer model.</p>

<p>For example, Llama 3 uses 4,096 feature dimensions internally, so 10 input
tokens are converted <code>10x4096</code> matrix. That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;real&rdquo; input into a transformer
model.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s no law that says that feature vectors <strong>must</strong> come from an
embedding model. That&rsquo;s a strategy that works well for text data, but if
we have data in a different format that we want to represent to a transformer
model we can simply use a different strategy.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t deduce what that &ldquo;different strategy&rdquo; might be for image
data.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-feature-dimensions">Number of Feature Dimensions</h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know what number of dimensions GPT-4o uses internally to represent
features because that&rsquo;s proprietary, but we can make some reasonable
assumptions:</p>

<p>OpenAI seems to likes powers of 2, sometimes with a factor of 3 mixed in.
For example, they used 1,536 for <a href="https://openai.com/index/new-and-improved-embedding-model/">ada-002</a> or 3,072 for <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models">text-embedding-3-large</a>.</p>

<p>For all I know, these publicly available embedding models are <em>literally</em> the
same ones used by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. If you have an excellent embedding model
sitting around, why not make some money off it?</p>

<p>So, it&rsquo;s likely that the number of feature dimensions used inside of GPT-4o is one of these:</p>

<div style="width: 50%; margin: auto">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th align="center">Dimension</th>
                <th align="center">Prime Factors</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">$1{,}536$</td>
                <td align="center">$3 \cdot 2^9$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">$2{,}048$</td>
                <td align="center">$2^{11}$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">$3{,}072$</td>
                <td align="center">$3 \cdot 2^{10}$</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">$4{,}096$</td>
                <td align="center">$2^{12}$</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say it&rsquo;s 3,072 for the sake of argument. The factor of three makes sense
because we start from three color channels and it&rsquo;s not a big deal if we&rsquo;re off
by a factor of 2 or 4.</p>

<h2 id="number-of-tokens">Number of Tokens</h2>

<p>TODO: move this elsewhere</p>

<p>Image tiles are square, so are likely represented by a square
grid of tokens. 170 is very close to <code>13x13</code>.</p>

<p>A single <code>&lt;|image start|&gt;</code> special token, followed by 169 consecutive
feature vectors representing the image.</p>

<p>How do we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x3072</code>?</p>

<p>Note that <a href="https://blog.eleuther.ai/rotary-embeddings/">RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings)</a> should help GPT-4o understand the
approximate positions of tokens within the image, but not perfectly.</p>

<h2 id="representing-images">Representing Images</h2>

<h3 id="strategy-1-raw-pixels">Strategy 1: Raw Pixels</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an extremely simple way to stuff an image into the embedding space:</p>

<ol>
<li>Divide the <code>512x512</code> into a <code>16x16</code> grid of &ldquo;mini-tiles.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Each mini-tiles is <code>32x32x3</code> flatten it a vector of dimension 3,072.</li>
<li>Each mini-tile is embedded in a single token.</li>
<li>The entire image tile is represented as 256 consecutive tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are two main problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>256 is slightly larger than 170, and</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s extremely stupid.</li>
</ol>

<p>By &ldquo;extremely stupid&rdquo; I mean that it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to embed using raw
RGB values and hope the transformer can handle it. For example, if the image is
shifted one pixel to the left, tokens generated in this way would suddenly have
very low similarity; there&rsquo;s no translational invariance. And that&rsquo;s just a
small taste of what goes wrong. The transformer architecture is optimized for
text, not images.</p>

<p>No, we should probably used a model that is designed and proven to be able
to handle image data.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-2-cnn">Strategy 2: CNN</h3>

<p>Just to get a sense of what the options are, let&rsquo;s take look at a classic CNN
architecture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/alexnet.png"></p>

<p>The basic building blocks are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Convolution Layer. These scan over an image in $k \times k$ sized blocks,
training small a small neural network.</li>
<li>Max Pool Layer. These also look at a $k \times k$ block, but simply take the
maximum value from each.</li>
</ol>

<p>AlexNet is historically important, but we should also look at some newer CNN
architectures. Since <a href="https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10">YOLOv10</a> just released a few days ago, let&rsquo;s take
a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767">YOLOv3</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/yolo_v3.png"></p>

<p>Here, the notation &ldquo;xN&rdquo; means that the entire block is repeated N times. YOLOv3
is 10 times as deep as AlexNet but is still very similar in some regards.</p>

<p>The main differences (which are characteristic of newer CNN architectures) are:</p>

<ol>
<li>A preference for <code>3x3</code> over larger kernels.</li>
<li>The use of &ldquo;stride 2&rdquo; convolutional layers instead of max pool layers. These
achieve the same step down in dimension but are thought to lose less
information.</li>
<li>The use of skip connections, show here as residual &ldquo;layer,&rdquo; which simply add
on the contribution from an earlier layer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network">prevent training degradation.</a></li>
</ol>

<p>A key point is that YOLO stops at <code>13x13</code>. That&rsquo;s because it doesn&rsquo;t predict
just one class for the entire image - it actually predicts an entire grid of
object classes. That&rsquo;s how it can see a large number of different objects in
the same image in a single pass. Hence the name: You Only Look Once. This is
basically what I think our hypothetical GPT-4o CNN must do too, only it&rsquo;s output
is a <code>13x13</code> grid of feature vectors.</p>

<p>These examples give us a pretty good sense of what a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; CNN would
look like. All we have to now is play a little game of connect the dots. How
can we go from <code>512x512x3</code> to <code>13x13x3072</code>?</p>

<p>Note: in the below I use the so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37674306/what-is-the-difference-between-same-and-valid-padding-in-tf-nn-max-pool-of-t">valid</a>&rdquo; padding strategy because
I&rsquo;m interested in stepping down the dimension and am not worried about keeping
the dimension exactly the same so that we can repeat blocks or use skip
connections. The practical upshot is that we lose a few dimensions ($k-1$ for
a $k \times k$ kernel) each time we apply a convolution layer.</p>

<!--
There's another decision which is important in determining output dimension:
the padding strategy. When a CNN kernel runs over the input layer, we have two
choices on how to handle the edges. 

Option One: we can simply start the kernel a little bit inside the image so it
doesn't go outside, and stop a little early on the other side. For example,
let's say we have a `3x3` kernel. Instead of looping from `(0, 0)` to `(width -
1, height - 1)`, we start with the kernel centered at (1, 1) and run to `(width
- 2, height 2)`. This strategy is called "valid" padding or no padding. A layer
with a $k \times k$ kernel that uses valid padding reduces the output dimension
by `k - 1`. 

Option Two: we can run the kernel from `(0, 0)` to `(width - 1, height - 1)`
but when we hit the edge and the kernel goes out of bounds, we'll pretend
like there are zeros everywhere outside the original dimensions. This strategy
is called "zero" padding. This keeps the output dimension exactly the same as
the input dimension. 
-->

<p>I tried
<a href="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative.png" target="_blank">several</a>
<a href="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png" target="_blank">different</a>
<a href="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative2.png" target="_blank">variations</a>,
but most of these
required special cases on one or more layers to &ldquo;fit.&rdquo; Until I found this one,
which steps down elegantly with no special cases at all:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative3.png"></p>

<p>It fits very neatly, doesn&rsquo;t it? From 512 to 13 dimensions in 5 identical
blocks, while simultaneously quadrupling the number of channels with each
block to hit the 3,072 number of features dimensions that we assumed.
Unfortunately, it also feels a little outdated because of the <code>5x5</code> kernels and
max pool layers.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an alternative that <em>almost</em> worked while staying closer to the YOLO
design:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_speculative4.png"></p>

<p>This unfortunately ended up at <code>12x12</code> instead of <code>13x13</code>. I mean, obviously
it could easily be forced to work, but where&rsquo;s the elegance in that?</p>

<p>While impossible to prove, these speculative designs demonstrate that there are
plausible CNN architectures that could do the job.</p>

<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>

<p>There still is a problem, however. The feature vectors generated by the CNN
from image data and feature vectors generated by the embedding model from
tokens/text may be being jammed into the same space, but they aren&rsquo;t actually
compatible. When you take the dot product between the embedding vector for the
token &ldquo;cat&rdquo; and the feature vector for an image of a cat you should get a
number close to one - they should be semantically similar.</p>

<p>Maybe this isn&rsquo;t a problem; maybe GPT-4o will simply learn two different &ldquo;languages&rdquo;
and learn to associate between them by training on labelled image data.</p>

<p>Problem: Aligning image semantics with token semantics</p>

<p>Possible Solution: Train the CNN to predict the embedding vector for the tagged token
For example, if there&rsquo;s a cat in the upper left, train it to predict the 3,072-dimension embedding vector for the token &ldquo;cat&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Possible Solution 2: End-to-End training</p>

<h2 id="experimental-validation">Experimental Validation</h2>

<p>Does GPT-4o really see a <code>13x13</code> grid of semantic feature vectors? I invented
a task, loosely inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards">Zener card</a>, to test this. The task is to
identify the color and shape for every symbol on a grid in an image.</p>

<p>I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/olooney/07850f0a2f0fcaac973ffabac765454a">simple program</a> to generate test grids that look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_5x5.png"></p>

<p>I then used this prompt to obtain comparison data:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;Divide this image into a {k}x{k} grid and describe the shape and color of
each cell. Report your results as a JSON array of array (no objects or row
labels) and use all lowercase.&quot;&quot;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>13x13</code> tokens hypothesis is correct, GPT-4o should do well on this task
up to about 13 and then performance should degrade. The CNN isn&rsquo;t literally
dividing the image up into a grid so it might start to degrade before then,
and might struggle more with even grid sizes than odd because the cells won&rsquo;t
be aligned.</p>

<p>However, that is not in fact what happens. Instead, performance is perfect for
<code>5x5</code> grids and smaller (no matter how many times I retried it) but began to
degrade rapidly after that, and by the time we reach <code>13x13</code> it was no better than
chance.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <code>7x7</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7.png"></p>

<p>For which GPT-4o returned this:</p>

<pre><code>[
    [&quot;blue diamond&quot;, &quot;purple triangle&quot;, &quot;red plus&quot;, &quot;purple circle&quot;, &quot;orange square&quot;, &quot;purple circle&quot;, &quot;blue circle&quot;],
    [&quot;blue diamond&quot;, &quot;red circle&quot;, &quot;green plus&quot;, &quot;red square&quot;, &quot;orange diamond&quot;, &quot;blue triangle&quot;, &quot;purple plus&quot;],
    [&quot;blue diamond&quot;, &quot;orange triangle&quot;, &quot;red square&quot;, &quot;orange square&quot;, &quot;blue plus&quot;, &quot;purple circle&quot;, &quot;blue circle&quot;],
    [&quot;green diamond&quot;, &quot;blue circle&quot;, &quot;orange circle&quot;, &quot;green circle&quot;, &quot;purple diamond&quot;, &quot;green triangle&quot;, &quot;orange diamond&quot;],
    [&quot;purple square&quot;, &quot;purple circle&quot;, &quot;green plus&quot;, &quot;green diamond&quot;, &quot;green circle&quot;, &quot;blue triangle&quot;, &quot;purple triangle&quot;],
    [&quot;red plus&quot;, &quot;red triangle&quot;, &quot;purple circle&quot;, &quot;blue triangle&quot;, &quot;orange triangle&quot;, &quot;red diamond&quot;, &quot;orange diamond&quot;],
    [&quot;orange plus&quot;, &quot;blue diamond&quot;, &quot;green triangle&quot;, &quot;green plus&quot;, &quot;green triangle&quot;, &quot;purple diamond&quot;, &quot;purple square&quot;]
]
</code></pre>

<p>It got <sup>38</sup>&frasl;<sub>49</sub> correct - an accurancy of 76%. The exact pattern of hits and
misses looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_7x7_results.png"></p>

<p>Performance continues to degrade as the grid size increases and by the time we
get to the <code>13x13</code> grid:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13.png"></p>

<p>The results are no better than chance:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/zener_13x13_results.png"></p>

<p>Does that mean I was wrong about 169 tokens representing a <code>13x13</code> grid?
Yes. Yes it does. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The great tragedy of science: the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.&rdquo; - Thomas Huxley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the <code>5x5</code> grid results are suggestive. It really can keep track of 25
distinct objects and their absolute positions within in the image. Maybe the
basic concept is right, I just got the dimension wrong. It would be easy
to tack on another couple of layers to our CNN to get down to <code>5x5</code> instead
of <code>13x13</code>. (This is left as an exercise for the reader.)</p>

<p>The trouble with <code>5x5</code> is that I can&rsquo;t get it to line up with the 170 token
cost. You can say, oh, maybe every cell is represented by 6 feature vectors,
not 1. That would be equivalent to a short sentence describing each cell;
that&rsquo;s not crazy. Maybe there are special row delimiter tokens at the end of
every row, maybe the whole image is bracketed by special start and end tokens.
I played with it for a while, but I don&rsquo;t see any clean way to get to exactly
170 token cost if we assume the CNN&rsquo;s output layer is <code>5x5</code>. For example, we
could use 6 feature vectors for each cell, and then 4 delimiters per row, that
would get us to 170. But that&rsquo;s not really a plausible way to structure the
data.</p>

<p>This does <em>NOT</em> explain how it does OCR.
YOLO can&rsquo;t really do OCR, especially not the high-quality OCR GPT-4o exhibits.
I have another theory for that: I think they&rsquo;re running tesseract (or their own in-house OCR) and feeding the identified text in alongside the image data.
I think that is why the early versions could be easily confused by text hidden in images; from its POV, that text <em>was</em> part of the prompt.
 (This is fixed now; GPT-4o is good at ignoring malicious embedded prompts.)
Malicious prompt rejection example.
However, this does not explain why there&rsquo;s no charge per token for the text found in an image.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this seems to suggest its actually <em>more efficient</em> to
send text as images:A <code>512x512</code> image with a small but readable font
can easily fit 400-500 tokens worth of text, yet you&rsquo;re only charged for 170
input tokens plus the 85 for the master thumbnail for a grand total of 255
tokens - far less than the number of words on the image.</p>

<p>This theory explains why there is additional latency when processing images.
The CNN would be essentially instantaneous, but OCR takes a bit of time. BTW
(and I&rsquo;m not saying this proves anything) but the Python environment used by
the OpenAI code interpreter has pytesseract installed. You can literally just
ask it to run pytesseract on any image you&rsquo;ve uploaded if you want to get a
second opinion.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<p>Well, we&rsquo;ve made a lot of speculative hay out of what is essentially only one
morsel of hard fact: that OpenAI used the magic number 170.</p>

<p>However, there does seem to be a complete plausible approach, very much in line
with other best practice CNN architectures such as YOLO, for mapping from
image tiles to embedding vectors.</p>

<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think 170 tokens is just an approximation used to bill for roughly
the amount of compute it takes to process an image. And I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re
concatenating layers to join image and text data the way some other multi-modal
models do.</p>

<p>No, I think GPT-4o is <em>literally</em> representing <code>512x512</code> images as 170
tokens, using an CNN architecture very similar to YOLO to embed the image
directly into the transformers semantic feature space.</p>

<p>The architectures that best &ldquo;fits&rdquo; is 5 layers of <code>5x5</code> convolutions
alternating with 5 layers of <code>2x2</code> max pooling, but honestly it could be nearly
anything.</p>

<p>The theory has a lot of predictive power: it explains how GPT-4o is able to
handle multiple images, and tasks like comparing two images, for example. It
explains how its able to see multiple objects in the same image, but gets
overwhelmed when there are too many objects in a busy scene. And it explains
why GPT-4o seems extremely vague and the absolute and relative positions of
separate objects within the scene; RoPE can only do so much.</p>

<p>Perhaps someday OpenAI will open-source GPT-4o and we&rsquo;ll be able to peek under
the hood and find out how it all works.</p>

<h2 id="postscript-alpha-channel-shenanigans">Postscript: Alpha Channel Shenanigans</h2>

<p>One interesting thing I noticed is that GPT-4o <em>ignores</em> the alpha channel,
resulting in somewhat counter-intuitive behavior.</p>

<p>When I say, &ldquo;ignores&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t mean that it gets rid of transparency by
compositing it onto some default background, the way an image editor might
when convert PNG to JPG. No, I mean it literally just grabs the RGB channels
and ignores the alpha channel.</p>

<p>We can illustrate this with four carefully prepared images. For convenience,
These images are displayed on top of a checkerboard pattern - the images
themselves have flat, transparent backgrounds.</p>

<p>What do I mean by &ldquo;transparent black&rdquo; or &ldquo;transparent white?&rdquo; Well, when
we represent an RGBA color with four bytes, the RGB bytes are still there
even when alpha is 100%. <code>(0, 0, 0, 255)</code> and <code>(255, 255, 255, 255)</code> are
in some sense different colors, even though there&rsquo;s no situation where a
correct renderer would display them differently since they&rsquo;re both 100%
transparent.</p>

            <div>GPT-4o Reads: &ldquo;&rdquo;</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s going on here? The pattern that emerges is that GPT-4o can read the
text if and only if the text color is different than the &ldquo;color&rdquo; of the
transparent background.</p>

<p>This tells us that GPT-4o <em>disregards</em> the alpha channel and only looks at the
RGB channels. To it, transparent black is black, transparent white is white.</p>

<p>We can see this even more clearly if we mess with an image to preserve the
three RGB channels while setting the alpha channel to 100%. Here&rsquo;s a little
Pillow function to do that:</p>

<pre><code>from PIL import Image

def set_alpha(image, output_path, alpha_value):
    # copy the image and ensure it's RGBA
    image = image.convert(&quot;RGBA&quot;)

    # set the alpha channel of every pixel to the given value
    pixels = image.getdata()
    new_pixels = [(r, g, b, alpha_value) for r, g, b, a in pixels]
    image.putdata(new_pixels)

    return image
</code></pre>

<p>I used that to make the two images below; they have identical RGB data, and
only differ in the alpha channel:</p>

<div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-item">
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" alt="Visible Platypus">
            <div>Alpha Channel = 255</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" alt="Hidden Platypus">
            <div>Alpha Channel = 0</div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>GPT-4o has no trouble seeing the hidden platypus:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/chatgpt_hidden_platypus_test.png" alt="ChatGPT passes the hidden platypus test."></p>

<p>You can try downloading the
<a href="/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus_hidden.png" download><code>hidden_platypus.png</code></a>
image and paste it into ChatGPT yourself; it will correctly describe it.
You may also note the image is 39.3 KB, the same size as
<a href="/post/gpt-cnn_files/platypus.png" download><code>platypus.png</code></a>
even though PNG compression should have made it much smaller if it was really
a perfectly blank, transparent image. Or you can use the above function to
set the alpha channel back to 255, recovering the original image.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is bug but its certainly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">surprising</a> behavior; In
fact, it feels like something a malicious user could use to smuggle information
past humans and directly to GPT-4o. However, GPT-4o is <em>much</em> better at
detecting and ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images:</p>

<p><img src="/post/gpt-cnn_files/gpt4o_malicious_test1.png"></p>

<p>(You can see several other examples of GPT-4o successfully detecting and
ignoring malicious prompts hidden in images in my <a href="https://olooney.github.io/image_tagger/gallery/index.html">gallery of GPT-4o test
images</a> generated by my <a href="https://github.com/olooney/image_tagger"><code>image_tagger</code></a> utility.)</p>

<p>So even if it is a bug, it&rsquo;s not obvious it can be exploited. Still, it would
be less surprising in GPT-4o &ldquo;saw&rdquo; the same thing that a human would in a
browser.</p>
